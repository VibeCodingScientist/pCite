After model establishment, rats were administered baicalin by gavage at doses of 25, 50, and 100&#xa0;mg&#xb7;kg&#x207b;<sup>1</sup> once daily for 4&#xa0;weeks, while the control and model groups received equivalent volumes of saline, and a prednisone group served as a positive control. Urine samples were collected at weeks 1, 3, and 5 for metabolomics analysis using UPLC-QTOF/MS. Bioinformatics and network analysis identified baicalin's targets in PF treatment. The study identified five urinary metabolites-5-L-glutamyl-taurine, 3-sulfinoalanine, indoxyl glucuronide, oxoglutaric acid, and uridine-as multiply-filtered candidate biomarkers associated with PF. An additional sterol-related feature at m/z 369.35 was retained only as a putative MSI level 3 signal and was not included in the core biomarker panel. Baicalin showed specific regulatory effects on the core metabolites. Bioinformatics analysis revealed 23 PF-related targets, with TYMS highlighted as a putative baicalin-related target in PF.

Unfortunately, it is typically diagnosed after normal kidney function is already significantly impaired. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of urine and plasma to explore whether metabolites can serve as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of DKD. Urine and plasma samples were obtained from 41 individuals [11 healthy controls, 20 patients with diabetes (diabetes mellitus or DM) and microalbuminuria, 10 patients with DKD]. A total of 342 metabolites were identified in urine samples and 252 metabolites were identified in plasma samples, with 182 metabolites overlapping between the two sample types. Among these, 58 metabolites from urine and 22 metabolites from plasma showed suggestive evidence (P-value &lt;&#x2009;.05) of differences between samples from patients with DKD and samples from healthy control individuals. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was applied to identify metabolomics profiles (in urine, plasma, or both) that maximize separation between DKD patients and controls. A set of four metabolites in plasma, including tyrosine and threo-hydroxyaspartic acid, shows promise as an early-stage biomarker signature that will need to be validated in a larger study. Using this set of metabolites, we estimated the probability of DKD for each of the DM patients, based on their metabolomic profiles, and found a significant correlation with DM designation (low, medium, and high) and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm their clinical utility and the ability to predict individuals at risk for DKD.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Recent advances in lipidomics have revealed that variations in lipid headgroups, acyl-chain length and saturation, sn-positional architecture, and oxidative modifications profoundly influence membrane mechanics, lateral organization, and protein-lipid interactions. These features collectively regulate fundamental cellular processes, including signaling, trafficking, curvature generation, and transbilayer asymmetry. In parallel, a wide range of pathological conditions-including cancer, metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory diseases-are increasingly associated with coordinated lipid remodeling that reshapes membrane material properties and electrostatic landscapes. In this review, we integrate biophysical principles with lipidomics-based evidence to elucidate how lipid chemical diversity translates into membrane-level behavior. We discuss the roles of major membrane lipid classes, the functional consequences of acyl-chain and sn-positional remodeling, and the biological significance of lipid asymmetry and lateral heterogeneity. Particular attention is given to disease-associated lipid reprogramming and extracellular vesicle lipidomes as functional extensions of cellular membranes. Finally, we examine key analytical barriers in modern lipidomics and outline strategies required to connect lipid structural information with biological function.

To elucidate these changes, we combined physicochemical assays with untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics to systematically profile the temporal metabolic alterations in goose egg yolks stored at 4 &#xb0;C for up to 60 days, using day-1 yolks as fresh controls. Our analysis quantified 1005 metabolites and identified a critical metabolic shift occurring after 30 days of storage. Among 21 significantly altered metabolites, the sustained decline of adenosine and 2-aminopurine, alongside the accumulation of 4-hydroxyretinoic acid, strongly correlated with the loss of egg freshness. Interaction network and pathway analyses pinpointed purine metabolism-with adenosine and 2-aminopurine as central nodes-as a core pathway impaired in yolk during storage. Crucially, we identify 2-aminopurine as a novel, storage-sensitive biomarker for goose egg freshness derived from yolk metabolomics, directly linking intracellular metabolic dysregulation to observable quality decline.

This study first investigated the lipidomic profile and functional effects of plasma EV derived from adiponectin-knockout (KO) mice to identify EV-associated lipid signatures linked to metabolic dysfunction. Lipidomic profiling revealed that KO EV were enriched in sphingolipids and polyunsaturated phospholipids compared to wild-type (WT) EV. To evaluate functional consequences, recipient cell assays were conducted using macrophages, skeletal muscle cells, and pancreatic beta cells. KO EV showed an increased uptake in RAW 264.7 macrophages and induced elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of NF-&#x3ba;B and IRF inflammatory pathways. In L6 skeletal muscle cells, WT EV increased ATP production, while KO EV failed to elicit this effect. Furthermore, KO EV impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic beta cells. These findings suggested that altered lipid composition in EV from KO mice contributes to oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired metabolic regulation in recipient cells. Next, translational relevance was established by documenting that plasma EV from patients with metabolic syndrome exhibited lipidomic remodeling features in parallel to the murine KO phenotype, in particular enriched PUFA-containing lipids. Together, these findings identify a conserved adiponectin-EV lipid composition axis regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired metabolic regulation.

However, an increasing number of studies have reported a variety of chiral metabolites across various living organisms, some biologically active and others identified as potential disease biomarkers. Enantiomers of the same compound may have distinct biological activities, chemical reactivities, and metabolism, highlighting the increasing attention to molecular chirality in biomedical research. Like peptides, amino acids, and organic acids, lipids also possess chirality and are essential components of biological membranes, influencing both structure and functionality. Studies using simple model systems, like liposomes and vesicles, challenge the assumption that only homochiral membranes are stable, demonstrating comparable stability in racemic heterochiral membranes. Nevertheless, chirality within eukaryotic cells remains largely overlooked, resulting in limited understanding of its impact on lipid membrane organization, lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions, and the overall lipid metabolism. This gap primarily reflects the lack of robust experimental methods for chiral lipidomics profiling. This review provides a comprehensive overview of analytical techniques used for the separation and analysis of chiral lipids in complex biological samples, emphasizing advances in chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques, and their application in disease biomarker discovery.

Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal widely presented in industry and some agrochemicals like fertilizers, which can persist in the environment. Despite the frequent co-occurrence of CPF and Cd as environmental pollutants, the combined toxicity of the two chemicals to insects has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of CPF and Cd on P. xylostella larvae using toxicity bioassays, biochemical analyses, and GC-MS-based metabonomics. The results showed that both chemicals inhibited the antioxidant enzyme activity with an antagonistic effect. In addition, CPF and Cd exposure altered a range of metabolites including valine, isoleucine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan, malic acid, butanoic acid, &#x3b1;-glycerophosphoric acid, pentanedioic acid, and deoxyribose. Metabolomic analysis further revealed that D-galactofuranose may serve as a biomarker for the co-exposure to CPF and Cd.

Temporal metabolic profiling was performed to identify potential signature metabolites. Temporal abundance patterns and correlation cluster analysis of metabolites were analyzed to determine metabolite biomarkers. The two SCs were incubated with pooled human liver microsomes for 24 h and were also evaluated in vivo in zebrafish. Metabolite profiles were characterized using UHPLC-QE Orbitrap-MS. HLM analysis identified 21 5F-ADB-PINACA metabolites and 28 5F-ADBICA metabolites. Metabolites of 5F-ADBICA were detected for the first time in vitro and in a zebrafish model. Zebrafish studies confirmed the presence of all key metabolites observed in HLM. Comparative analysis of their metabolic pathways revealed differences in metabolism driven by structural differences between the indazole and indole cores.

In addition to genetic mutations such as BRAF^V600E^ and NRAS, lipid metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a critical factor in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Lipid metabolism supports melanoma cell survival, phenotypic switching, immune evasion, and resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapy, while also modulating susceptibility to ferroptosis. This review summarizes current knowledge on lipid dysregulation in melanoma, highlighting alterations in fatty acid synthesis, desaturation, uptake, storage, and oxidation, as well as changes in phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol, and bioactive lipid mediators. These lipid pathways are tightly regulated by oncogenic signaling networks, including MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, and are influenced by tumor microenvironmental stressors such as hypoxia and nutrient limitation. Advances in lipidomics technologies, particularly mass spectrometry-based approaches, have enabled comprehensive profiling of lipid alterations at bulk, spatial, and single-cell levels, offering new opportunities for biomarker discovery and therapeutic stratification. Targeting lipid metabolic vulnerabilities represents a promising strategy to improve melanoma diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment efficacy.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

These symptoms, coupled with reduced sleep quality, impaired daily productivity and decreased mood, highlight a significant yet underrepresented disease burden. Recent advances in tear-based multi-omics have enabled detailed characterisation of OA-associated biochemical changes on the ocular surface, highlighting human tears as a promising biospecimen for diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target research. This review discusses emerging proteomic, lipidomic, metabolomic and miRNA findings comparing OA sufferers with healthy controls, and, where relevant, with comorbid conditions such as dry eye disease and keratoconus. Differential expression patterns across these analytes implicate key pathways involved in immune response, wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress and return to homeostasis on the ocular surface. By integrating these data into a stepwise model of OA biopathway activation, this review outlines candidate biomarkers and highlights methodological advances that may support translation of tear multi-omics into clinical tools for OA management.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Replacing blood-based sampling with sebum sampling will allow these benefits to be leveraged as well as enable researchers to better include protected populations, such as children, who tend to be excluded from biomarker research. However, for researchers to obtain meaningful lipidomic data sets in routine studies, more information is needed regarding sebum sampling feasibility and variability. Herein, we assess the feasibility of forehead sebum sampling from child participants. Furthermore, using high resolution mass spectrometry in combination with both supervised and unsupervised classification, we determine the variability of the lipid profile according to the age, sex, and biological relatedness of 98 participants, ages four to 73. Outcomes of this study indicate that age plays a notable role in the sebum lipid profile, while both biological sex and biological relatedness have little to no impact on these lipids. Importantly, sebum sampling from the forehead proved to be a successful sampling approach for children, as children appeared enthusiastic about participation and samples were collected rapidly and painlessly. Together, these results equip researchers with information necessary for designing effective, sebum-based biomarker studies, and they demonstrate that sebum collection is an ideal sampling approach for biomarker studies in children.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Understanding the metabolic alterations in OC can provide insights into its pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets. This study aimed to explore serum metabolomic profiles and their correlation with clinical and pathological features in OC patients. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: Thirty serum samples were collected from patients diagnosed with ovarian tumors (OTs) (n = 24 malignant, n = 6 benign) and undergoing treatment at Careggi University Hospital. Additionally, 47 samples were obtained from age-matched healthy female donors. Serum samples underwent processing and analysis using an H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) platform to identify a panel of metabolites. Correlation analysis between the metabolomic data and clinical parameters was performed using R software (v.4.4.0). <b>Results</b>: Differential metabolomic profiling showed a significant upregulation of metabolites associated with the purine salvage pathway (i.e., hypoxanthine and inosine) and the ketone bodies axis (i.e., acetone, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and acetate) in samples from ovarian tumor (OT) patients compared to healthy donors. Within malignant OC samples, metabolomic profiles significantly correlated with BRCA1/2 mutation status (BRCA1/2-mutated vs. wild-type) and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. <b>Conclusions</b>: The analysis revealed significant variation in specific metabolites such as betaine, creatinine, carnitine, glycerol, and mannose; notably, a downregulation of these metabolites was observed in HRD-positive patients. The study identifies significant metabolomic alterations in OC, implicating pathways such as purine salvage and ketone bodies.

However, the magnitude of the damage is generally assessed through the visible indicators. Phytoplankton communities form the base of the aquatic food web; thus, developing methods to assess their damage is crucial. In this study, we simulated chemical spill conditions using field water and sediment collected from a river stream. Subsequently, the metabolome of the sediment containing dead phytoplankton was profiled, as it is expected to provide insights into population-level damage and the timing of death. Nontargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was applied. The results revealed distinct differences in metabolite abundances depending on the extent of phytoplankton population-level damage, as measured by algal growth rate inhibition. Furthermore, a total of 120 potential biomarker candidates were found, including 117 tentatively annotated metabolites and 3 putatively annotated metabolites, which may indicate phytoplankton population-level damage or the timing of death. Fatty acids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and other plant- or organism-derived secondary metabolites and natural products were recognized as major biomarker candidates.

Analyzing causal mediation in high-dimensional omics data presents challenges, including complex dependencies among mediators and the need for advanced regularization or Bayesian techniques to ensure stable and interpretable estimation and selection of indirect effects. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian framework to identify active pathways and estimate indirect effects in high-dimensional mediation analysis. Central to our method is the introduction of a set of priors for the selection indicators in the mediator and outcome models. A Markov random field prior leverages mediator correlations, enhancing power in detecting mediated effects. Sequential subsetting priors encourage simultaneous selection of relevant mediators and their indirect effects, ensuring a more coherent and efficient variable selection framework. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method provides superior power in detecting active mediating pathways.

This study systematically assesses how common sample handling variables including sample dilution, freeze-thaw cycling, blood staining and viscosity reduction (<i>via</i> hyaluronidase digestion and bead beating) affect the metabolomic profile of synovial fluid. Using a combination of untargeted GC-ToF-MS and UHPLC-MS (in both electrospray ionisation modes; ESI+ and ESI-) for the profiling of both polar and non-polar metabolites, we evaluated changes in detectable metabolite numbers, small molecule class distribution and relative abundances in a collection of synovial fluid samples.

Limitations in current diagnostic methods hinder early detection and intervention, creating an urgent need for novel early diagnostic biomarkers. This study employed an integrated multi-omics approach, combining metabolomics, Mendelian randomization (MR), and transcriptomics data to identify potential AMI biomarkers. Plasma metabolomic profiling revealed 174 differentially abundant metabolites. Subsequent MR analysis pinpointed a key causal metabolite, L-arachidoyl carnitine (carnitine C20:0). Genes associated with this metabolite were retrieved from the GeneCards database and cross-referenced with differentially expressed genes from the GEO database, leading to the identification of 10 candidate biomarker genes: ACSL1, PYGL, DYSF, MGAM, SLC7A7, SULF2, KCNJ2, CYP1B1, NCF2, and SLC22A4. By constructing and evaluating 80 machine learning models, the Enet[alpha = 0.1] model was determined to have the optimal diagnostic performance. The diagnostic potential of these ten genes was further corroborated by logistic regression with tenfold cross-validation. Additionally, immune cell infiltration analysis using the CIBERSORT algorithm uncovered potential associations between the candidate genes and specific immune cell subpopulations. In conclusion, this sequential multi-omics investigation successfully identifies and validates 10 gene biomarkers related to AMI, offering new perspectives for early precision diagnosis and insights into the disease's pathogenesis, alongside potential therapeutic targets.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming data analysis, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns from high-dimensional datasets and facilitating the development of predictive models. This shift is particularly transformative in cancer research, where understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its spatial dynamics is crucial for improving therapeutic outcomes. This review explores recent advancements in spatial omics (SO) including spatial transcriptomics (ST) and spatial proteomics (SP), and AI-driven computational models, focusing on their applications in oncology. We discuss key methodologies, including spatial barcoding, in situ sequencing, and digital spatial profiling, and highlight major platforms. AI-powered tools, including deep learning models and spatial graph-based analyses, enhance data interpretation, allowing for robust predictive modeling, biomarker discovery, and personalized therapeutic strategies. Despite their transformative potential, ST and AI-driven approaches face challenges, including high-dimensional data complexity, computational constraints, and standardization of analytical pipelines. Addressing these challenges requires advanced mathematical frameworks such as spatial graph theory, topological data analysis, and agent-based modeling, which refine data integration and improve biological insights. Future research should focus on enhancing spatial resolution, cross-platform data harmonization, and AI-driven predictive models to advance precision oncology.

Efforts to improve the performance of early detection and precise treatment are urgent and important for BC management. In clinical application, compared with highly complex classification functions, precise, simple and biologically interpretable algorithms can strengthen the understanding of disease development and facilitate the personalization of therapeutic strategies. In this study, a novel readily interpretable decision rule involving multiple forms of molecular relationship (RI-MFR) was proposed for cancer clinical management applications. In RI-MFR, linear and nonlinear pairwise molecule comparisons were comprehensively analyzed by a joint probability mass function for the identification of top scoring pairs from high dimensional biomolecular data. Based on the selected few molecule pairs, accurate, readily interpretable decision rules were inferred to provide biological insight as to how classification was performed. RI-MFR can effectively eliminate the influence of sample variability caused by individual differences. RI-MFR was successfully employed to analyze changes in metabolic mechanisms during BC development based on genomics datasets and metabolic alterations before and after BC therapy using our metabolomic profiling. The experimental results indicated that genes and metabolites involving in the glycosphingolipid metabolism may be the crucial factors associated with BC development and contribute to the enhanced effectiveness of BC treatment.

Metabolomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed to identify the blood biomarkers. The efficacy of Lianpu Drink in treating SSDHS was evaluated by observation of the general conditions of the rats and examination of the pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tissue. In addition, metabolomics was employed to unravel the endogenous small-molecule metabolites regulated by Lianpu Drink. A total of 32 blood biomarkers of SSDHS model rats were identified. Lianpu Drink significantly reduced the rectal temperature and alleviated the pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tissue of the model rats. 12-Ketodeoxycholic acid, glycodesoxycholic acid, oleoylcarnitine, lysophosphatidylcholine(LysoPC) P-18:0, LysoPC 20:1 sn1, monoacylglycerol(0:0/22:6/0:0), and 3&#x3b2;,16&#x3b1;-dihydroxyandrostenone sulfate were identified as the key callback metabolites in the Lianpu Drink treatment of SSDHS. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based serum pharmacochemistry of traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to investigate the in vivo constituents of Lianpu Drink under observable therapeutic effects and a total of 12 in vivo constituents of Lianpu Drink were identified. Molecular docking was adopted to predict the correlation between in vivo constituents and key metabolic enzymes. The results showed that coptisine, berberine, epiberberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, shanzhiside, phellodendrine, gentiobioside, magnoloside F, and magnolol had good binding affinity with the key enzymes of callback metabolites, including choloylglycine hydrolase(CGH), 7&#x3b1;-dehydroxylase(7&#x3b1;-DH), phospholipase A2(PLA2), carnitine palmityl transferase &#x2160;(CPT-&#x2160;), sulfotransferase 2A1(SULT2A1), and sulfatase(SULF).

In our 2012 review of 21 studies, we found that most patient breast tumors exhibited increased GSH levels compared to peritumoral tissue. However, there was no clear relationship between GSH levels and histological grade, clinical stage, or patient outcome. For this update, database searches found 59 studies that reported the levels of any of 10 metabolites, including GSH, cysteine (Cys), ascorbate (Asc), and taurine (Tau), in breast tumor tissues. The increase in the number of studies profiling tumor metabolites is mainly due to the use of an array of relatively new metabolomics technologies. However, many of these metabolomics methods are not designed to prevent sample oxidation during tissue procurement and processing. Despite this, these recent studies confirm that the levels of most of the antioxidants or related metabolites are increased in patient breast tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. In addition, poor patient outcomes are often associated with tumor tissues with higher GSH and lower Tau levels. GSH levels also increase with histological grade. There are no clear trends in the relationship between any of the antioxidant levels and tumor stage or genetically defined subtypes. Clearer trends may emerge with more uniform tissue sampling, preparation, and assay procedures. In addition, the increased use of spatial metabolomics methods may help to clarify the relationship between antioxidant levels and clinical markers.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

This review critically synthesized these interdisciplinary innovations, highlighting how the integration of stable isotope methodologies, omics platforms-including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics-and AI-driven data analytics enables dynamic, quantitative mapping of nutrient metabolism and gene-diet interactions.

Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), we simultaneously quantified 29 nucleotide intermediates both in plasma and matched urine samples from 58 propensity score-matched pairs of AKI and non-AKI (NAKI) critically ill patients. Compared with NAKI controls, AKI patients showed decreased levels of 7 urinary nucleotide intermediates and increased levels of 4 plasma metabolites. Urinary nucleotide levels correlated more strongly with SCr and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) than their plasma counterparts. Elevated urinary xanthine and other 5 metabolites were identified as protective factors for AKI, while elevated plasma adenine, thymine and cytosine were risk factors. A combination of urinary guanine and xanthine with plasma thymine discriminated AKI risk with an area under the curve (AUC = 0.880, 95% CI = 0.800-0.934).

These metabolites reflect how the body responds to the drug.We compared the two methods and found that metabolites can predict all seven major side effects more accurately than measuring the drug level in blood. These metabolites are related to important body functions such as cell growth and inflammation. This may be why they can better show how the body is handling the treatment.If this method is used in hospitals, it could help doctors choose the best dose for each person, reduce harmful side effects, improve treatment results, and lower medical costs for patients.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Participants included Gulf War-era veterans seen in the Miami Veterans Affairs Hospital eye clinic from 2018-2022. Cases met GWI criteria, while controls were non-deployed, age- and gender-matched veterans without GWI. Participants completed systemic and ocular symptom questionnaires, and lipidomic profiling of tears and plasma quantified sphingolipids and eicosanoids.

Changes in tear composition could be associated with ocular and systemic diseases such as meibomian gland dysfunction and dyslipidemia. Profiling tear lipids may help biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis and management. However, common tear sampling methods present distinct limitations: Schirmer's strips frequently cause ocular irritation and discomfort due to their large contact area with the eye surface, while microcapillary tube collection could yield low reproducibility due to operator variability, especially when performed by different personnel. These limitations might compromise the accuracy and consistency of lipidomic data. This study introduces a minimally invasive phenol red thread (PRT)-based sampling method optimized for tear lipidomics. The thin structure of PRT minimizes the risk of ocular irritation and allows rapid and gentle tear collection. This user-friendly and easy-to-perform method is suitable for subjects with reduced tear volume or lower tolerance for foreign body sensation, and it enables more reproducible sample collection by reducing operator-dependent variability. Tear lipids collected by PRT were extracted using an optimized methanol/methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) phase separation protocol and analyzed by high-resolution LC-Orbitrap-IQX MS/MS with LipidSearch software. The workflow identified more than 700 unique tear lipid species, each characterized by specific fatty-acid-derived product ions. These results indicate that PRT-based sampling provides robust lipid recovery for tear lipidomic analysis. This minimally invasive and reproducible approach offers a practical platform for clinical and experimental tear lipid research.

Ex vivo machine perfusion provides a dynamic platform for such evaluation and is increasingly used to support organ selection. Numerous traditional biomarkers, such as perfusion parameters and injury markers, have been proposed, but their predictive value remains limited. These markers are mostly validated in the in vivo setting and may not hold the same relevance during ex vivo perfusion, where physiology is fundamentally different. Furthermore, interpretation is complicated by variables such as perfusion temperature, duration, perfusate, and device-specific settings. To date, no single biomarker during machine perfusion can guide clinical decision-making. Molecular profiling offers a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of traditional markers. While traditional biomarkers typically reflect late-stage damage or narrow aspects of cell injury, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic techniques allow detection of early, system-wide responses to ischemia and reperfusion. The use of these methods during machine perfusion can reveal multilayered signatures of injury, stress, and metabolic adaptation before transplantation. This review briefly discusses traditional biomarkers and elaborates on recent molecular studies performed during ex vivo kidney perfusion. Findings from preclinical studies include upregulation of inflammatory signaling, oxidative stress responses, cytoskeletal remodeling, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although largely observational, emerging data suggest that certain molecular patterns may correlate with injury and posttransplant outcomes. Despite the need for clinical validation, molecular profiling during machine perfusion could enable more objective assessment of graft viability.

Current therapies offer limited symptomatic relief but fail to halt neurodegeneration. Serum exosomal lipids, which reflect brain pathophysiology through blood-brain barrier crossing vesicles, present promising minimally invasive biomarkers. However, a standardized framework for their systematic development is lacking. We propose a structured three-phase approach comprising discovery, analytical validation, and clinical utility assessment. The discovery phase employs nontargeted lipidomics of serum exosomes from AD patients and controls integrated with machine learning to identify dysregulated pathways and prioritize candidate biomarkers. Analytical validation involves targeted quantification using UPLC-MS/MS to optimize sensitivity and specificity within complex matrices, with rigorous performance evaluation via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) analysis in independent case-control cohorts establishing preliminary diagnostic cut-offs. Clinical utility assessment requires longitudinal evaluation in treated AD cohorts to correlate biomarker dynamics with disease progression or therapeutic response, refine diagnostic thresholds, and explore presymptomatic risk prediction.

In a 10-day human fasting study, we previously identified a surge in the circulating inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP), which we leveraged in the current study to identify novel metabolic inflammatory correlates. With a variety of longitudinal metabolic variables as input, including metabolomics, we identified branched chain amino acids (BCAA) as the top candidate inflammatory correlate. We then used in vitro myeloid/macrophage culture and in vivo murine models to test BCAA as a determinant of inflammatory signaling. Short-term exposure to BCAA alone had modest effects on a variety of immune readouts; however, when coupled with a second stimulus, such as exposure to endotoxin or when administered to diet-induced obese mice, members of the JAK/STAT/cytokine signaling pathways were augmented on the transcriptional level by concurrent BCAA administration in multiple tissues, including visceral adipose and liver. The modifying effect of BCAA on inflammatory stressors translated into increased levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these data position BCAA as an immune priming factor, a potential mechanism underlying the well-established association between circulating BCAA and diverse diseases of aging.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Therefore, enhancing feed efficiency is a key strategy to mitigate these costs and environmental impacts. This is particularly relevant in the context of the heavy pig system in which animals are slaughtered at a heavier live weight than in many other production systems to follow the rules of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) value chains. Since growth rate is correlated with feed efficiency, and under PDO rules, pigs cannot reach the slaughter weight earlier than a set age limit, the daily gain of the pigs needs to be controlled. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to identify plasma metabolites in Italian Large White heavy pigs that may differentiate between animals with divergent feed efficiency and growth rate, and that may constitute biomarkers for one or the other trait. From a starting cohort of 672 performance-tested pigs, two partially overlapping datasets of 200 pigs each, extreme and divergent for feed conversion ratio (FCR) and average daily gain (ADG), were selected. Approximately 700 metabolites were analysed in the plasma of these pigs. Metabolomic data were analysed with the Boruta machine learning algorithm. Discriminant metabolites were further evaluated through univariate and multivariate analyses. Boruta identified 10 and 7 metabolites that differentiate between FCR and ADG extreme pigs, respectively, with an additional metabolite shared by the two datasets. Most metabolites selected in the FCR dataset still show significant abilities to discriminate among high and low ADG pigs, even if they have not been selected in the Boruta analysis, showing medium to high values of Area Under the Curve, and highly significant Mann-Whitney test U P-values, while the opposite was not true. Among the metabolites detected, L-carnitine and O-adipoylcarnitine, both involved in fatty acid metabolism, were significantly higher in pigs with high FCR. Isoleucylhydroxyproline and prolylhydroxyproline, linked to collagen turnover, were higher in low FCR pigs, potentially reflecting more efficient protein metabolism. Other metabolites linked to gut microbiome activity significantly differentiate between high and low FCR and ADG pigs, suggesting a potential role of the microbiota in nutrient utilisation. The identified metabolomic profiles confirm that feed efficiency and growth rate are related yet distinct traits, whose independent consideration will enhance the accuracy of biomarker discovery and genetic selection in Italian heavy pigs.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

While its use is authorised in some countries, it is strictly prohibited in Europe due to food safety issues and ethical concerns. Consequently, robust analytical strategies, including immunoassays and LC-MS/MS, are employed for its detection. In this study, we applied untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics profiling using liquid chromatography-high&#x2011;resolution mass spectrometry (LC&#x2011;HRMS) to investigate the systemic effects of rbGH administration. Urine and milk samples were collected from nine dairy cows over a time course covering multiple stages of rbGH treatment. Data pre-processing and feature extraction were performed using the Galaxy Workflow4metabolomics platform, and discriminant metabolites were selected through multivariate models based on variable importance in projection (VIP). Results showed that urine metabolomics revealed rapid perturbations in polar metabolites shortly after the first rbGH administration, while milk lipidomics highlighted more progressive and dynamic shifts in lipid composition. These findings demonstrate an early disruption of polar metabolism followed by slower reprogramming of lipid metabolism. This integrative LC&#x2011;HRMS approach provides new insights into the molecular consequences of rbGH exposure, contributing both to the development of refined biomarker strategies for monitoring unauthorised hormone use in livestock and to a better understanding of the intrinsic hazards associated with rbGH.

Despite its potential, SPME faces several challenges when analyzing trace-level metabolites in exhaled breath, primarily due to complex sample matrices, insufficient enrichment efficiency, and slow mass transfer kinetics. Here, we targeted aldehyde and ketone biomarkers associated with gastric cancer and engineered a hierarchically porous, amino-functionalized microporous organic network (HP-NH<sub>2</sub>@MONs) as a high-performance SPME fiber coating. This prepared coating architecture enables rapid extraction (&#x2264;30 min) and highly selective enrichment of aldehyde and ketone biomarkers, achieving enrichment factors ranging from 185 to 6872. The exceptional adsorption performance of HP-NH<sub>2</sub>@MONs is attributed to a synergistic dual-mode mechanism combining hydrophobic interactions with amino-group-mediated hydrogen bonding. This mechanism not only enhances the selective enrichment of aldehyde and ketone biomarkers but also provides strong anti-interference capability, thereby markedly improving the reliability, sensitivity, and robustness of the analytical method for trace biomarker detection. Coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the proposed HP-NH<sub>2</sub>@MONs-SPME-GC-MS method delivers outstanding analytical performance, characterized by high sensitivity (limits of quantification: 0.067-2.7 ppt), excellent precision (RSD &#x2264; 9.6%), and robust accuracy (recoveries of 82.2%-116.2%). Applied to exhaled breath samples, the method enabled sensitive detection of target biomarkers and clear differentiation between healthy individuals and gastric cancer patients.

The serum biomarker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) lacks specificity in distinguishing clinically significant PC (sPC) from insignificant PC (isPC), leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves detection, it is expensive, is time-consuming, and may involve inter-reader discrepancies. Recently, metabolomics, which has a high analytical sensitivity and broad molecular-feature coverage, has emerged as a promising tool to risk-stratify PC. This review examined studies of blood and urine metabolomics for sPC biomarker identification. Significant metabolite changes in sPC patients often involved fatty acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, purine/pyrimidine metabolism, and tyrosine/phenylalanine metabolism. Specifically, more than one study reported increased lactate and phenylalanine levels, along with decreased tyrosine, xanthine, and histidine levels, in sPC patients. Several metabolic panels outperformed serum PSA in predicting sPC, particularly when combined with clinical factors. Among these, two urine-based tests may have higher accuracy in predicting sPC than most current commercially available assays. However, direct comparison between studies may be inappropriate due to methodological heterogeneity, the variability in biospecimen types, inconsistent use of digital rectal examinations, and different sPC definitions and predictive endpoints. Most relevant studies were of small sample size or lacked external validation. Despite these challenges, metabolomics-based liquid biopsies show strong potential for improving sPC detection.

By applying a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we systematically investigated the potential causal effects of plasma lipids on kidney stones and assessed the mediating role of inflammatory proteins through a two-stage MR analysis.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has emerged as a promising platform for metabolic profiling, but its capability is hindered by the limited light absorption and energy transfer of conventional matrix materials. In this work, a high-efficiency metabolic detection platform based on high-entropy oxide particles (mHEO) with an interconnected mesoporous structure and tailored compositions is established. Owing to their abundant active sites and excellent light utilization efficiency, the mHEO particles show significantly improved photothermal and photochemical properties with an eightfold localized enhanced electromagnetic field and higher surface temperatures (616&#xa0;&#xb0;C) than nonporous HEOs (336&#xa0;&#xb0;C). As a result, MALDI-MS based on the mHEO matrix exhibits high sensitivity, good reproducibility (Coefficient of Variation &lt; 10%), and ultralow detection limits with 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than their endogenous concentrations. Furthermore, the mHEO-based MALDI-MS platform is applied to analyze paired arterial/venous blood samples from pancreatic cancer (PC) patients with the assistance of machine learning. Four tumor microenvironment-associated metabolites are identified as a potential biomarker panel of PC, achieving a robust pancreas-venous plasma classification, which allows the timely screening and targeted treatment of PC.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

Clinical diagnosis of IMDs presents significant challenges due to phenotypic heterogeneity, nonspecific symptoms, and the limited scope of current targeted biochemical assays typically available. Recent advances in mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics offer promising solutions to several of these challenges by simultaneous detection and relative quantification of thousands of metabolites, not relying on any prior hypotheses. With the expansion of genetic diagnostics via whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, metabolic insights are often crucial for understanding the pathogenicity of genetic variants of unknown significance, often enabling a clear diagnosis for patients. This review details current applications of untargeted metabolomics in IMDs, including biomarker discovery and elucidation of previously unknown pathophysiological mechanisms. Successful examples of biomarker identification in well-studied IMDs, such as pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy and phenylketonuria, are highlighted to provide novel disease insights. Additionally, we address technical and interpretation challenges inherent to this methodology, particularly concerning metabolite identification, high-dimensional data complexity, and limited patient numbers. Emerging analytical technologies and data analysis approaches are highlighted that are poised to mitigate these challenges in the upcoming years.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived oxylipins are critical mediators of cardiac inflammation; their plasma profiles in DCM and diagnostic potential remain undefined. We aimed to comprehensively quantify plasma oxylipins in patients with DCM, identify dysregulated lipid pathways, and develop a noninvasive biomarker panel for disease classification. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-three oxylipins were quantified by targeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in plasma samples from 30 patients with DCM and 30 age/sex-matched healthy controls. Differential metabolites were identified using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), and empirical Bayes analysis of microarrays (EBAM). Intersecting features defined a high-confidence signature. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) detected enriched lipid mediator pathways. Diagnostic performance was evaluated with a support vector machine (SVM) model using hold-out validation. RESULTS Sixteen oxylipins significantly differed according to Wilcoxon testing. Overlap with SAM and EBAM identified 14 core metabolites dominated by lipoxygenase-derived hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandin E2, and cytochrome P450-derived hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids, with concomitant suppression of pro-resolving mediators. IPA revealed activation of eicosanoid signaling, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 signaling, and prostanoid biosynthesis. A 6-marker SVM panel (15-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, 9-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 6R-lipoxin A4, prostaglandin E2, 16-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid) achieved an area under the curve of 0.876 (sensitivity 74.2%, specificity 75.9%).

This chapter emphasizes the value of multi-omics integration in understanding the biology of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genomic studies reveal risk variants such as APOE &#x3b5;4 in Alzheimer's and rare mutations in familial forms. Transcriptomics highlights gene expression changes, including synaptic dysfunction in early Parkinson's and alternative splicing errors in TARDBP-related ALS. Proteomics identifies key protein aggregates like amyloid beta and alpha-synuclein, along with modifications such as hyperphosphorylated tau that correlate with cognitive decline. Metabolomics uncovers metabolic alterations, including mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's and lipid peroxidation in ALS, which contribute to disease progression. By combining these layers with high-throughput tools like single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and mass spectrometry, researchers can reconstruct molecular networks linking genetic risk, gene regulation, protein dysfunction, and metabolic imbalance. This approach enables patient stratification into molecular subtypes, such as neuroinflammatory clusters defined by microglial gene signatures and cytokine expression. Biomarkers from blood and cerebrospinal fluid allow for minimally invasive disease monitoring. Despite challenges such as data heterogeneity and limited standardization, multi-omics approaches support biomarker discovery and therapeutic development. Integrating these datasets with neuroimaging and digital tools enhances diagnostic precision and guides targeted interventions, such as antisense therapies for SOD1-linked ALS.

In this study, we employed a nontargeted metabolomics strategy. By conducting multivariate statistical analysis on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) data from rat urine and plasma to elucidate the metabolic disruptions induced by fentanyl and carfentanyl. Adult male SD rats were randomly assigned to four groups: low-dose fentanyl group, high-dose fentanyl group, low-dose carfentanyl group, and high-dose carfentanyl group. All groups underwent continuous tail vein injection of toxicants for 5 consecutive days.

EVs show promise as neurological disease biomarkers due to their molecular makeup reflecting their parent-cell composition signature and due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. To date, the vast majority of research in this field has explored the protein profiles of EVs; however, lipids play an important role not only in the formation of EVs, but also in mediating cellular function and the pathological progression of many neurodegenerative conditions. Herein, we take a critical first step in determining the potential utility of EV lipids as biomarkers in neurological disease. In&#xa0;vitro we exposed BV-2 microglia to either control media or media containing lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a known pro-inflammatory stimulus, for 24&#x2009;h then isolated both the cells and their EVs and performed LC-MS/MS. For the first time, we reveal distinct lipidomic changes can differentiate resting versus pro-inflammatory microglia and their EVs, while distinct lipids are preserved between EVs and their parent cell. Moreover, we add to current literature by demonstrating acute pro-inflammatory activation of microglia results in the activation and suppression of distinct lipidomic pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that analysis of lipid-based relationships between parent cells and their EVs may be a useful tool to infer cellular function. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that lipidomic analysis can not only differentiate the functional state of cells in&#xa0;vitro but can also differentiate their EVs. We lay the first brick in a foundation to support future research into EV lipids as novel and exciting biomarker candidates in neurological disease.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Herein, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) was used to differentiate malignant from benign endometrial tissues and assess lipidomic differences among patients with obesity and diabetes. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was performed in the same patients to gain insights into the altered signaling pathways and investigate the protein expression levels in endometrial cancer cases and controls. Tissues from 64 women (50 cancer, 14 benign) were analyzed with DESI-MSI achieving 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Discriminatory spectral features were primarily phospholipids [phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI)], all elevated in cancer. Proteomics revealed upregulated proteins linked to commonly dysregulated pathways in endometrial cancer, namely PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/RAS, and Wnt signaling pathways. Lipidomic differences were found between high- (obesity/diabetes) and low-risk phenotypes (no obesity/diabetes), with PE and PS elevated in high-risk benign and PE reduced in high-risk cancer cases. A single phospholipid (PE(O-38:4)) was found as discriminatory in both normal and cancer cohorts, which may serve as biomarker in women with benign histology at high-risk of developing endometrial cancer.

The disease, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), triggers a complex immune response that leads to metabolic alterations, particularly in lipid metabolism, which plays a key role in inflammation and disease progression. Despite advancements in diagnostic methods, the search for novel biomarkers may support the development of new diagnostic tools for faster patient screening. In this study, we applied a lipidomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the serum lipid metabolome of children and adolescents infected with DENV (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;25) compared to controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;15). Multivariate statistics included partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to assess group separation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate biomarker performance. The PLS-DA revealed a tendency of separation between groups, with component 5 showing the highest predictive power (Q2&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68345).

ROC curve analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 80% for the metabolite of m/z 246.265, and a sensitivity of 96% for all metabolites, as a set. The metabolites were attributed to sphingolipids, fatty acids, glycerol lipids, and sterols.

Here, an integrated approach combining bionic sensory analysis and multi-omics techniques was applied to study prolonged storage. Visual marketability loss occurred after two-year storage for browning, while peak shifts in olfactory and gustatory profiles occurred after one-year and three-year storage, respectively. Although bionic sensing revealed multidimensional patterns, integrative omics pinpointed one-year as the critical phase, jointly supported by GC-IMS and LC-MS/MS. Non-volatile metabolite analysis revealed 281 metabolites exhibited significant changes within the first year of storage. Most metabolites exhibited limited abundance changes during storage; only 86 metabolites exhibited large abundance changes, including the typical functional components of jujube, cAMP and cGMP.

However, research on glycolipid metabolic disturbance associated with human exposure to DE remains scarce. Based on the cohort of diesel engine testers (DETs), this study revealed that DE exposure could disrupt liver function and interfere with the glucose and lipid metabolism in humans. By combining targeted analyses of amino acids and fatty acids with untargeted lipidomics approaches, we comprehensively elucidated the altered plasma metabolic profiles induced by DE exposure. A total of 8 amino acids, 3 fatty acids, and 36 lipids were identified as differential metabolites. These perturbed metabolites further indicate the impaired glycolipid metabolism, and furnish evidence of the adverse health risks resulting from DE exposure, primarily encompassing insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), liver diseases, and neurotoxicity. A machine learning-based regression algorithm identified metabolites that are likely to mediate changes in the clinical indicators related to glycolipid metabolism. Mediation analysis and validation cohort showed that alanine (Ala), AcCa(21:1), and PC(38:1) potentially serve as early predictive biomarkers for DE-induced alterations in glucose levels.

In this study, we used metabolomics and lipidomics to analyze serum samples from healthy controls, hypertensive AD patients, and normotensive AD patients, revealing distinct metabolic and lipidomic perturbations associated with AD, independent of blood pressure status. Notably, mitochondrial dysfunction was a pivotal factor in AD pathogenesis, and key metabolites such as acetylcarnitine served as both an AD biomarker and an indicator of disrupted lipid metabolism. Lipidomic profiling further revealed a consistent accumulation of specific fatty acids in AD patients, including elevated levels of FA(16:1), FA(20:1), FA(22:5), and FA(20:2) in both hypertensive and normotensive subgroups. Additionally, the sphingolipid signaling pathway was the most markedly altered lipidomic pathway between the two AD groups. These findings offer new insights into the complex lipidomic and metabolic mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis, paving the way for improved diagnostics and targeted therapeutic strategies.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

In this study, we conducted longitudinal metabolomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 23 TBI patients (9 mild, 14 severe) and 5 uninjured controls using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Comprehensive quantification of metabolites was performed at three critical post-injury time points (days 1, 3, and 7), revealing distinct temporal metabolic patterns. Our results demonstrated significant alterations in the CSF metabolome following TBI. Early-phase changes (day 1) predominantly involved energy-related metabolites, including sphingosine, glucose, and dl-lactate. More pronounced metabolic shifts were observed by day 3, characterized by marked variations in amino acids (l-glutamine, l-histidine) and medium-chain fatty acids (caprylic acid, octanoic acid), suggesting the transition from primary to secondary injury mechanisms. The day 7 profile revealed accumulation of repair-associated metabolites such as 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycerol, potentially indicative of processes occurring in the chronic phase, which may include both reparative mechanisms and ongoing pathology. Notably, we identified significant alterations in established biomarkers (trimethylamine N-oxide) and novel small peptides (e.g., Gly-His-Lys), with distinct metabolic signatures differentiating mild versus severe TBI cases. These findings delineate temporally dynamic and severity-dependent metabolic reprogramming in TBI, providing mechanistic insights into the progression from acute injury through secondary pathogenesis to chronic recovery phases.

It is a degenerative disorder characterized by progressive macular damage and systemic metabolic dysregulation. Metabolomics elucidates relationships between metabolic alterations and disease phenotypes, providing scientific foundation for biomarker-driven predictive diagnostics. Current AMD staging predominantly relies on a linear classification based on clinical symptoms and imaging phenotypes. But metabolic alterations often precede morphological changes, providing a crucial window for early screening and intervention. Recent multi-biofluid metabolomic studies have identified key metabolic biomarkers, including glycerophospholipid pathway metabolites, acylcarnitines, branched-chain amino acids, and adenosine. They are predictive of transition from non-advanced to advanced stages. This review summarizes stage-specific metabolic biomarkers across AMD progression, such as 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (18:0-20:4&#xa0;PC), sphingosylphosphorylcholine (LysoSM[d18:1]), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC[18:4]), short-chain acylcarnitines (e.g., acetylcarnitine [C2]), long-chain acylcarnitines (e.g., linoleoylcarnitine [C18:2]), and valerylcarnitine (C5). These biomarkers may allow for timely intervention before irreversible visual impairment and underscore the importance of differential metabolic signatures between stable and progressive stages for early disease management. By unveiling the dynamic changes of these critical metabolites, and providing evidence for their prognostic value in stage transition, this review proposes an evidence-based foundation for early risk stratification and precision intervention in AMD.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

However, this healthcare-associated mycosis caused by Candida spp. is difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms, and the lack of early and accurate detection methods. IC is also difficult to treat due to its late diagnosis, the limited antifungal arsenal, and the rapid emergence and spread of (multi)drug-resistant Candida strains. Therefore, early and accurate innovative methods for species and resistance identification in IC (candidemia and deep-seated candidiasis) are urgently needed to initiate timely and appropriate antifungal therapy, and reduce its high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in hospitalized patients (especially, severely immunocompromised or critically ill patients). The availability of the complete genome sequences of the most clinically relevant Candida species coupled with recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies have spurred an unprecedented era in the discovery and development of IC diagnostics at different levels of molecular complexity. Here, we review the contribution of current and emerging omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, peptidomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, glycomics, immunomics (immunoproteomics, immunopeptidomics, and immunoglycomics), imiomics (imaging-omics), and microbiomics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabonomics), to the process of biomarker development for early diagnosis, antifungal susceptibility, prognosis, follow-up, and therapeutic monitoring in IC. We highlight the potential of integrating multiple omic data (through integromics, multiomics, or panomics, together with systems biology and artificial intelligence) for the discovery of multidimensional biomarker signatures and computational algorithms for IC diagnosis. Finally, we discuss future challenges and prospects for their clinical implementation. These next-generation IC diagnostics promise to revolutionize medical practice by unraveling the complexity of biological systems at multiple levels.

Our previous work established 2-(4-Boronobenzyl) isoquinolin-2-ium bromide (BBII) as a highly effective derivatization reagent for enhancing hydroxyl metabolite sensitivity in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Building upon this, we herein introduce a novel and robust extension: BBII derivatization integrated with desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) for <i>in situ</i> hydroxyl metabolite detection. This innovative approach involves incorporating BBII directly into the DESI spray solvent, leading to significant sensitivity enhancement through instantaneous derivatization reaction. We demonstrate substantial signal increases ranging from 1.8- to 17.2-fold for hydroxyl metabolite reference standards, making previously undetectable compounds such as glucose, hexadecanol, and estradiol readily observable. When applied to mouse brain tissue sections for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), BBII-DESI successfully revealed the distinct spatial distributions of representative hydroxyl metabolites, including glucose and cholesterol that are typically invisible to conventional methods. A key advantage of this methodology is the characteristic boron isotopic pattern of BBII-derivatized features, facilitating rapid and precise screening and identification. This BBII-assisted DESI strategy effectively unveils the \"dark metabolome\" of hydroxyl compounds, providing access to previously inaccessible metabolic information. Our method broadens the utility of ambient ionization techniques by enabling direct analysis of biological samples with minimal preparation, which is crucial for high-throughput applications.

The predictive accuracy and clinical utility of the model were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analyses, respectively. In addition, the abundances and effects of selected metabolic biomarkers on trastuzumab resistance were validated in trastuzumab sensitivity (TS) and TR cell lines. TCA cycle-related metabolites were separated in a 4-min run, and the method was validated over a broad concentration range, revealing good linearity, accuracy, and precision. Differential analysis revealed consistent elevations in fumaric acid, malic acid, and succinic acid abundances in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer compared to HC and in the TR cell line compared to those in the TS cell line. Using the LASSO-LR model, four variables were found to be significant predictors of trastuzumab resistance and were included in the nomogram: fumaric acid, malic acid, clinical status and lymph node metastasis. A high-risk group susceptible to resistance to trastuzumab was identified based on the nomogram scores. In vitro assays indicated the accumulation of fumaric acid and malic acid effectively alleviated the proliferation inhibitory and inducing apoptosis effects of trastuzumab on TS cell line. Fumaric acid and malic acid were identified as biomarkers for predicting the incidence of TR, and high abundances of these metabolites significantly reduced the sensitivity of the TS cell line to trastuzumab.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Infection with any of the four serotypes of DENV can result in a self-limiting but debilitating febrile illness (DF), and some infections progress to severe disease with hemorrhagic manifestations and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [DHF/DSS]). DENV infection drives the metabolic state of host cells for viral benefit and induces a host-immune response with metabolic implications that link to disease. Here, a dynamic metabolic response to DENV infection and disease was measured in 535 pediatric patients from Nicaragua using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Metabolomic analyses revealed profound disruptions of critical biochemical pathways and metabolites within the circulating metabolome, especially in those with more severe manifestations of dengue disease. A biomarker panel of 28 metabolites was utilized to classify DF versus DHF/DSS with high sensitivity and specificity, equating to a balanced accuracy of 96.88%. Identified metabolites belonged to biochemical pathways of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, sphingolipids, dipeptides, purines, and tryptophan metabolism. Dipeptides emerged as the most critical molecules for severe disease classification. Additionally, a previously reported trend between serotonin and platelets in DHF patients was expanded upon here, revealing a major depletion of serotonin, but not platelets, in DSS patients. In this study, the perturbed metabolome was used for disease state classification and exploration of the biochemistry of severe dengue disease pathology.IMPORTANCEThe international burden of dengue is intensifying, as the number of reported cases in only the first 5 months of 2025 exceeded that of the previous annual high in 2023. The occurrence of deadly severe manifestations of dengue disease will escalate as the total cases rise, and pediatric patients are at greater risk of developing the rapidly progressing severe dengue diseases than adults. Suboptimal vaccines, lack of clinically approved therapeutics, and no methodologies for prognosis of severe disease exacerbate the difficulty of preventative and supportive care. Because human metabolism is rapidly altered due to infection, perturbations in patients' circulating metabolome can be attributed to dengue disease and correlated to severity. This study contributes metabolic biomarkers of dengue disease in pediatric patients from Nicaragua, indicating that metabolic biomarkers are conserved across patients of different ages and geographic and genetic backgrounds. With validation across many cohorts, there is potential to improve diagnostics.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

TMT-based proteomes and an untargeted metabolomics approach were used to conduct the proteomics and metabolomics in heat-stressed (HS, <i>n</i> = 6) and heat-resistant (HR, <i>n</i> = 6) Chinese Holstein. The proteomics showed that 29 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), with SERPINA3-7, ACTN4, and PLOD1 up-regulated, and GSN down-regulated in HR cows. The metabolomics showed that 168 differential positive metabolites and 170 differential negative metabolites were identified, with HR cows exhibiting lower levels of anti-inflammatory compounds, such as N6-Acetyl-L-lysine. In addition, 29 DEPs and 338 metabolites revealed four key pathways, including the lysine degradation (ko00310) and metabolic pathway (ko01100) with underlying protein-metabolite interactions, where up-regulated PLOD1 and ACTN4 and down-regulated EXT1 and GSN were observed to be interacting with the down-regulated N6-Acetyl-L-lysine, citric acid, 4-Pyridoxic acid, uracil, and uric acid, and the up-regulated arachidonic acid was enriched, which could be used for rapid and noninvasive screening of heat-tolerant cows. Functional validation through cell experiments, qPCR, and Western blot analyses showed that the interference of the <i>ACTN4</i> gene could induce dairy cow mammary epithelial cell apoptosis, which could be regarded as a potential biomarker for HS in Chinese Holstein. Our results facilitate a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the HS issue in dairy cows and provide a crucial insight into the alternative strategies to enhance animal welfare and productivity under high-temperature conditions.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Despite its clinical significance, the timing and mechanisms underlying this intersystem inflammation remain elusive. Leveraging a mouse model of influenza-induced pneumonitis and enteritis, we integrated time-course metabolomics with dynamic network biomarker (DNB) analysis to uncover pivotal transitions and potential molecular mechanisms. Two critical tipping points were identified at 1-2&#xa0;days post-infection (dpi) and 6 dpi, after which the disease course markedly shifted. Metabolite clustering highlighted significant alterations in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism at 1-2 dpi, implicating its likely involvement in modulating pulmonary and intestinal inflammation. By 6 dpi, prominent changes in both AA and bile acid (BA) metabolism were observed, suggesting the potential existence of an inflammatory feedback loop that may amplify systemic inflammation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that 16 AA and BA metabolites (AUC&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;0.7) have diagnostic potential as biomarkers.

As AD advances, the metabolic profiles of the brain and other organs undergo significant changes. Metabolomics serves as an invaluable tool for discovering biomarkers to enable early diagnosis of AD. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we analyzed brain tissues (from the frontal cortex and hippocampus), cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma from TgF344-AD rats (n = 8 males) and wild-type rats (n = 8), aged 7 months, identifying 710 analytically robust metabolites across the four biological matrices. A similar methodology was applied to 12 rats aged 22 months. Our results highlighted that the metabolomic profiles and altered metabolic pathways varied between early and advanced stages in both central and peripheral matrices. At 7 months, the metabolic fingerprint showed alterations predominantly affecting amino acid and lipid metabolism, whereas by 22 months, it shifted to a distinct fingerprint impacting amino acid, lipid, and nucleotide metabolism.

Microorganisms with protein-hydrolyzing and lipid-degrading activities can act on proteins and lipids, ultimately resulting in the release of undesired metabolites. Characterizing the corresponding microbiota and metabolite profiles and clarifying their relationships will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the spoilage of pasteurized goat milk during chilled storage. In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing was employed for microbiome profiling, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was used for metabolome profiling. Weighted gene correlation network analysis and Spearman's correlation analysis were both used to investigate correlations between the microbiomes and metabolomes of pasteurized goat milk samples. The results showed significant changes in microbial diversity throughout the spoilage process. The Proteobacteria phylum and Pseudomonas genus were identified as dominant microorganisms involved in the spoilage process. Bacteria may contribute to spoilage through metabolic pathways such as glycerophospholipid metabolism and purine metabolism. In addition, significant correlations were observed between key bacteria taxa and important metabolites. Stenotrophomonas was identified as the primary spoilage bacterium, the relative abundance of which increased significantly (by 3.84%) during chilled storage, and it may serve as a biomarker for goat milk spoilage. Taking all this information into consideration, the present study proposes an integrated microbiome and metabolomics approach to investigate the spoilage mechanisms of pasteurized goat milk caused by microbial activity. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the microbial and metabolic profiles associated with spoilage during chilled storage.

Studies in lab organisms in controlled environments, while powerful and complex, fall short of capturing the breadth of genetic and environmental variation in nature. Thus, there is now a major effort in geroscience to identify aging biomarkers that might be applied across the diversity of humans and other free-living species. To meet this challenge, the Dog Aging Project (DAP) aims to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns of aging in complex systems, and how these are shaped by the diversity of genetic and environmental variation among companion dogs. Here we surveyed the plasma metabolome from the first year of sampling of the Precision Cohort of the DAP. By incorporating extensive metadata and whole genome sequencing, we overcome the limitations inherent in breed-based estimates of genetic effects, and probe the physiological basis of the age-related metabolome. We identified effects of age on approximately 36% of measured metabolites. We also discovered a novel biomarker of age in the post-translationally modified amino acids (ptmAAs). The ptmAAs, which are generated by protein hydrolysis, covaried both with age and with other biomarkers of amino acid metabolism, and in a way that was robust to diet. Clinical measures of kidney function mediated about half of the age effect on ptmAA levels. This work identifies ptmAAs as robust indicators of age in dogs, and points to kidney function as a physiological mediator of age-associated variation in the plasma metabolome.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

This study introduces an enhanced Aird compression format optimized for spatial metabolomics through two innovations: (1) a dynamic combinatorial compression algorithm for integer-based encoding of <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> and intensity data; (2) a coordinate-separation storage strategy for rapid spatial indexing. Experimental validation on 47 public data sets demonstrated significant performance gains.

Thus, longitudinal analyses of body weight (BW), serum immunoglobulins, biochemical parameters, and untargeted metabolomics at three key developmental stages: postnatal day 5 (PND 5, crop milk dependence; N = 10), PND 15 (transition to grains; N = 10), and PND 25 (independent grain intake; N = 10) were conducted. The BW increased significantly between PND 5 and PND 15 (P &lt; 0.05), concomitant with elevated serum glucose, albumin, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein. Immunoglobulin (Ig) dynamics revealed a significant decline in IgA at PND 15 and PND 25 relative to PND 5 (P &lt; 0.05). The IgG showed a temporary significant decrease at PND 15 compared to PND 5 (P &lt; 0.05), returning to PND 5 levels by PND 25. Metabolomics demonstrated dynamic pathway alterations. Comparing PND 15 to PND 5, differential metabolites were significantly enriched in five pathways (P &lt; 0.05), most prominently alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (P &lt; 0.001) and purine metabolism (P = 0.003). The PND 15 to PND 25 transition featured prominent shifts, notably in glycerophospholipid metabolism (P &lt; 0.001) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle continuation (P = 0.026). Crucially, PND 25 vs PND 5 analysis identified seven remodeled pathways, with core reprogramming involving alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (P &lt; 0.001), arginine biosynthesis (P &lt; 0.001), and the TCA cycle (P = 0.002), which emerged as a central metabolic hub.

Conversely, immunoglobulins correlated positively with purine metabolites and bile acids.

Advancements in multi-omics have revolutionized the understanding of PTB pathogenesis, offering new opportunities for early prediction and risk categorization. This review highlights emerging liquid biomarkers derived from proteomic, metabolomic, genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic studies, emphasizing the integrative power of multi-omics approaches. Proteomic analyses have revealed key proteins in maternal and fetal compartments associated with inflammatory and extracellular matrix pathways, while metabolomics have identified lipid and metabolite profiles linked to energy metabolism and fetal development. Genomic and epigenomic studies have uncovered genetic variations and microRNAs involved in uterine contractility and immune modulation, providing novel insights into PTB's molecular underpinnings. Transcriptomic research further underscores the act of long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating gene expression and inflammatory responses. Multi-omics integration, coupled with machine learning models, has demonstrated superior predictive accuracy by synthesizing data across these domains, revealing intricate molecular interactions underlying PTB. Future research should prioritize longitudinal multi-omics studies to capture dynamic biological changes during pregnancy, expanding diverse population cohorts to enhance generalizability. Translating multi-omics insights into clinical practice necessitates collaborative efforts to develop cost-effective, accessible biomarker panels and establish standardized guidelines for implementation. These advancements hold the potential to transform prenatal care through personalized risk assessment and targeted preventive strategies, reducing the global burden of PTB.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2026}

THC has both acute and chronic effects through the dopaminergic and endocannabinoid systems. This study was conducted to better understand the metabolites and metabolic pathways in biological systems affected by cannabis, which may help find practical diagnostic and treatment approaches for people with cannabis dependence in the future. Metabolomic analysis of urine samples was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). MetaboAnalyst software was used to determine sample metabolite profiles, which were then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. From data of over 200 metabolites in each sample of cannabis users, 92 metabolites with a <i>p</i>-value of less than 0.05 were selected for further analyses, of which 38 showed a decrease and 54 showed an increase compared to the nonuser group. Based on 43 metabolites (VIP &gt; 1), subjected to MetaboAnalyst and CPDB, amino acid metabolism (especially arginine, methionine, and cysteine), vitamin metabolism (particularly biotin), and the urea cycle were the primarily affected metabolic pathways. The AUC values of the four metabolites (salsoline, 6-thiourate, procollagen 5-hydroxy-<i>l</i>-lysine, and biotin) with the highest VIP scores were between 0.93 and 0.98, with no significant difference.

Serum samples from drug-treated MDD patients with persistent depression (D-MDD), patients in remission (R-MDD), and healthy controls were divided into discovery (D-MDD: n=19, R-MDD: n=17, control: n=25) and validation (D-MDD: n=36, R-MDD: n=30, control: n=65) sets.

We used liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to generate untargeted metabolomic profiles and identified top biomarker signatures differentiating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive from negative samples via machine learning. We then adapted these signatures to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for targeted profiling and assessed classification performance, including samples positive for other respiratory viruses and negative for viral testing. A total of 1,226 samples were tested, including 521 positive samples for SARS-CoV-2, 97 for influenza A, 96 for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 211 for other respiratory viruses, and 301 negative samples. The top-performing model was the Light Gradient Boosting Model, which showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.00), sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91-0.99), and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-0.97).

In this study, we investigated the use of a distinct diagnostic approach, mass spectrometry for detection of metabolites (small molecules) combined with machine learning analysis, for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. We demonstrated strong performance of this approach directly from upper respiratory swab samples to differentiate SARS-CoV-2-infected versus uninfected individuals. Extension of this approach to influenza and RSV maintained a high level of performance. This research suggests that mass spectrometry-based infectious disease diagnostic testing has clinical potential and that these metabolomic features may reveal novel host-pathogen interactions and therapeutic targets.

Pregnancy monitoring, however, is challenging due to delayed implantation and obligatory pseudopregnancy, which limits the effectiveness of traditional immunoassays (IA). To remedy this, we combined polar metabolomics and steroidomics to enable a comprehensive view of the urinary molecular composition across six different reproductive phases spanning six pregnant and seven pseudopregnant cycles. Statistical comparisons revealed 696 discriminative features, including 174 features in the early luteal stages, well before the current pregnancy diagnostic window. Pregnant and pseudopregnant cycles showed differences in amino acid, energy, and steroid metabolism before and after CL reactivation, with androgen levels being significantly elevated in pregnant females specifically, suggesting a role in embryo implantation. Interestingly, we detected only one existing IA target metabolite, but identified other discriminative metabolites that may underlie IA signal detection. Finally, we demonstrated that classification models comprising biomarker panels may improve (early) pregnancy diagnosis with accuracies ranging from 0.763 to 1.000 across reproductive phases.

In this study we demonstrate that pretreatment of serum and plasma samples with 1% formic acid (FA, v/v) prior to acetonitrile (MeCN)-induced protein precipitation significantly enhances analytical performance in untargeted metabolomics using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-MS. We show an increase in sample preparation reproducibility and signal intensity across both positive and negative ionization modes. In two independent serum cohorts (OPTIMA and VITACOG), FA-based extraction improved multivariate modeling (orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis, OPLS-DA), with consistently higher classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, alongside reduced variability and increased fold-changes in discriminatory compound-features. We investigated factors potentially involved in the enhanced performance and observed outcomes consistent with the disruption of noncovalent protein-metabolite interactions and the stabilization of labile species. We found no correlation with either protein depletion or differential adduct formation. The results were also not attributable to lowering pH after metabolite extraction. In summary, we demonstrate that FA pretreatment of plasma and serum, prior to protein precipitation, significantly improves sample reproducibility and detection sensitivity in untargeted RPLC-MS metabolomics.

In this study, we describe a targeted and validated method that combines benzoyl chloride derivatization with reversed-phase ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (RP-UHPLC/MS/MS) for the quantitative analysis of the human serum lipidome. In total, 450 lipid species from 19 lipid subclasses were identified based on a combination of multiple reaction monitoring transitions, retention dependencies, dilution series, and derivatization tags. The developed methodology increases the sensitivity for most investigated lipid classes in comparison to conventional methods, but the highest improvement was observed for monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, sphingoid bases, and free sterols. The method's accuracy was confirmed using NIST SRM 1950, as the determined concentrations were in agreement with the consensus values from ring trials. Lipidomic profiling of clinical samples revealed a significant dysregulation of lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Key findings included the upregulation of most monoacylglycerols and sphingosine, and a pronounced downregulation of sphingolipids with very long saturated N-acyl chains and phospholipids containing fatty acyl compositions 18:2 and 20:4.

The kynurenine pathway demonstrated a shift toward neurotoxic metabolites, alongside reductions in microbial-derived indoles, indicating inflammation and gut dysbiosis. Energy metabolism was impaired, with changes in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and mitochondrial function. Lipid metabolism showed widespread dysregulation involving phospholipids, sphingolipids, endocannabinoids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, some modulated by treatments such as ocrelizumab and interferon-&#x3b2;. Nitrogen metabolism was also affected, including amino acids, peptides, and nucleotides. Non-classical and xenobiotic metabolites, such as myo-inositol, further reflected host-microbiome-environment interactions. Several studies demonstrated the potential of metabolomics-based machine learning to distinguish MS subtypes. These findings highlight the value of metabolomics for biomarker discovery and support its integration into personalized therapeutic strategies in MS.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

In addition to the systemic accumulation of thymidine and deoxyuridine, several case studies have reported abnormalities in a range of other metabolites in patients with MNGIE. Since metabolites are intermediates or end-products of numerous biochemical reactions, they serve as highly informative indicators of an organism's metabolic activity. This study aimed to perform an untargeted metabolomic profiling to determine whether individuals with MNGIE exhibit a distinct plasma metabolic signature compared to 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Metabolites were profiled using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). A total of 160 metabolites were found to be significantly upregulated and 260 downregulated in patients with MNGIE. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed disruptions in 20 metabolic pathways, with arachidonic acid metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis being the most significantly upregulated. Univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses identified 23 individual metabolites with diagnostic potential, each showing an area under the curve (AUC) &#x2265; 0.80. We propose that an impaired resolution of inflammation contributes to a chronic inflammatory state in MNGIE, potentially driving disease progression. Additionally, we suggest that the gut-liver axis plays a central role in MNGIE pathophysiology, with hepatic function being bidirectionally influenced by gut-derived factors.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

SMPDL3B, a membrane-associated protein expressed in renal podocytes, is essential for lipid raft integrity and glomerular barrier function. We hypothesize that reduced membrane-bound SMPDL3B may contribute to podocyte dysfunction and impaired renal physiology in ME. To investigate this, we quantified soluble SMPDL3B in plasma and urine as a surrogate marker of membrane-bound SMPDL3B status and assessed renal clearance and plasma metabolomic profiles. In a cross-sectional study of 56 ME patients and 16 matched healthy controls, ME patients exhibited significantly lower urine-to-plasma ratios of soluble SMPDL3B and reduced renal clearance, suggesting podocyte-related abnormalities. Plasma metabolomics revealed dysregulation of metabolites associated with renal impairment, including succinic acid, benzoic acid, phenyllactic acid, 1,5-anhydroglucitol, histidine, and citrate. In ME patients, plasma SMPDL3B levels inversely correlated with 1,5-anhydroglucitol concentrations and renal clearance. Multivariable modeling identified the urine-to-plasma SMPDL3B ratio as an independent predictor of clearance. Female ME patients showed more pronounced SMPDL3B alterations, reduced clearance, and greater symptom severity. Non-linear associations between soluble SMPDL3B and lipid species further suggest systemic metabolic remodeling. These findings support soluble SMPDL3B as a potential non-invasive biomarker of renal-podocyte involvement in ME, highlighting sex-specific differences that may inform future therapeutic strategies.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Therefore, we investigated biomarkers in the lipid fractions of plasma from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) for the screening diagnosis of PDAC. <b>Methods</b>: We screened common fatty acid types in human (normal 99, PDAC 103) and mouse (normal 7, KPC 22) plasma samples using a non-targeted approach. Subsequently, we identified targets in human plasma (set A: normal 68, PC 102) that could distinguish between healthy individuals and patients with cancer. Next, we verified whether the identified targets were useful in a new human set (set B: 96 normal, 78 PC). We combined sets A and B to create set C and further divided it into a training set (7:3 ratio; normal 115, pancreatic cancer 126) and a validation set (normal 49, PC 54). The identified targets were used to train three statistical models (logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel). <b>Results</b>: The comparison of human and mouse plasma identified eight common lipid metabolites. We further identified four platforms containing these metabolites for target analysis: acylcarnitines, phospholipids, fatty acid amides, and sphingolipids. We analyzed the four platforms using sets A, B, and C and found 20 lipids (1 acylcarnitine, 1 sphingolipid, and 18 phospholipids) that met the criterion of AUC &#x2265; 0.75 in all three sets. Based on an average AUC for LR models with 11 or more phospholipids, the separation performance between healthy individuals and patients with cancer was 0.9207 (sensitivity, 90.74%; specificity, 86.22%; PPV, 87.90%; NPV, 89.42%), and the AUC of the validation set for CA19-9 in the same groups was 0.7354.

Metabolomics, a key approach in systems biology, offers insights into the complex pathophysiology of diabetes by analyzing low-molecular-weight compounds in biological contexts. This study investigated metabolite alterations in the aqueous humor of diabetic and non-diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery to identify potential biomarkers associated with diabetes. Aqueous humor samples from 191 patients (48 diabetic, 143 non-diabetic) were analyzed using targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolite data were normalized and statistically evaluated using univariate analysis, including fold change calculations, t-tests, and volcano plots. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using KEGG, SMPDB, and RaMP-DP databases. Key findings revealed differential abundance of several metabolites, including upregulated 3-hydroxykynurenine, histamine, and octanoylcarnitine, and downregulated putrescine in diabetic patients.

Many people use humidifiers to improve dry eye disease (DED). The current study was performed to elucidate the effect of PHMG-p on eye dryness in a rat model using metabolomics. Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to PHMG-p (0.1% and 0.3%) following a previously established DED induction model using scopolamine hydrobromide and desiccation stress. Ocular surface damage was assessed using corneal fluorescein staining, tear volume measurement, and tear break-up time (TBUT). Plasma and urine samples were analyzed using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR-based metabolomics to identify metabolic alterations associated with PHMG-P-p exposure and DED pathogenesis. PHMG-p exposure exacerbated DED symptoms, as evidenced by a significant reduction in tear volume, shorter TBUT, and increased corneal damage compared to the control group. Metabolomic profiling identified distinct metabolic changes in PHMG-p-exposed groups, including alterations in glutamate, glycine, citrate, and succinate metabolism. These metabolic changes correlated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x3b1; in the corneal and lacrimal gland tissues.

The subtypical variability of AE calls for individualized treatments based on specific antibodies and clinical manifestations. Early and accurate diagnosis and standardized treatment are essential to improve prognosis and promote neurological recovery. Currently, clinical diagnosis of AE relies on the detection of specific antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, there is usually a delay in this approach, leading to late initiation of treatment, which may result in patients' disease progression yet still not effectively treated. For example, for some specific subtypes of AE, existing antibody tests may not capture all potential markers in time, making early diagnosis and subtyping challenging. In addition, certain AE patients have low antibody levels that make it difficult to confirm the diagnosis with conventional assays, resulting in a delayed diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new methods to improve the efficiency of differential diagnosis based on the sensitivity, specificity, or accessibility issues faced by antibody-based diagnosis. With the help of multi-omics technologies, potential biomarkers of AE can be identified through genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, leading to improved diagnosis.

Nevertheless, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms linked to menopausal transition, which could be of great value in designing new interventions addressed to improve the health of both perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. We used an ovarian-intact middle-aged model of rats resembling the characteristics of human perimenopause and applied liquid and gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry approaches for the determination of polar and lipid-related metabolites to identify characteristic circulating signatures across perimenopause. The gradual loss of regularity in the estrous cycle occurring during the natural transition to reproductive senescence was associated with altered circulating levels of estradiol, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) and, in rats that were in an acyclic state, with ovary atrophy and with a lack of stromal luteinization and corpus luteum. These results were accompanied by progressively significant changes in the 144 lipid-related metabolites detected in serum as the estrous cycles were losing regularity. Furthermore, we identified 18 lipid-related metabolites-including 9 phosphatidylcholines, 4 lysophosphatidylcholines, 2 phosphatidylethanolamines, cholesterol ester (18:2), 5&#x3b1;-androstane-3,17-diol, and 17,18-dihydroxyarachidonic acid-that already changed with the transition from a regular to an irregular estrous cycle and anticipated the changes in blood progesterone, LH, and cholesterol levels that occurred in acyclic rats.

It ranks among the leading causes of death and severe disability worldwide. The etiology of cerebral infarction is multifaceted, with common risk factors including dietary patterns, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. In recent years, the role of the gut microbiota in systemic immunity and tumorigenesis has been intensively explored, thrusting the research on the gut-brain axis into the spotlight. However, there is a lack of literature investigating the relationship between the gut microbiota and blood metabolites in cerebral infarction. In this study, we employed 16S rRNA analysis and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for a comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of fecal samples from cerebral infarction patients and the general population. Our results revealed a significant correlation between the gut microbiome and serum metabolites, highlighting the impact of the microbiome on metabolic pathways. Specifically, we found that 35 gut microbiome taxa, such as Actinobacteriota and Peptostreptococcales-Tissierellales, were significantly enriched in the control group (N group). Through Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis, 72 taxa showed significant differences between cerebral infarction patients and healthy individuals. Among them, 22 key taxa were identified as microbial biomarkers for differentiating patients from healthy controls. These findings suggest that variations in the microbiome and metabolites could potentially serve as biomarkers for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cerebral infarction.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

In this study, we exploited the pH-responsive behavior of ZrO&#x2082;-SiO&#x2082; composite microspheres to establish the first single-sample, dual-channel solid-phase extraction (SPE) pretreatment method: under acidic conditions, Zr&#x2074;&#x207a;-PO&#x2084;&#xb3;&#x207b; coordination selectively adsorbs phospholipids, whereas under basic conditions, NH&#x2084;&#x207a; competes to gently elute them. The flow-through and elution fractions are used for metabolomic and lipidomic analyses, respectively. We integrated the entire workflow into an automated pretreatment platform and coupled it with high-resolution LC-IMS-QTOF detection to enable high-throughput processing. Method validation demonstrated high phospholipid recovery and excellent preservation of polar metabolites (representative results: LPC 18:0 elution recovery 100.1 % &#xb1; 3.0 %; DPPC elution recovery 94.0 % &#xb1; 2.0 %; 25-OH-VD&#x2083; flow-through retention 99.0 % &#xb1; 2.0 %). In serum from diabetic patients and healthy controls, 390 differential metabolites were identified in the metabolome, significantly enriched in energy metabolism pathways such as galactose metabolism; lipidomics revealed disturbances in glycerophospholipid metabolism, indicating membrane signaling remodeling. Importantly, the dual-channel approach captured for the first time the coordinated disruption of the galactose-ether-lipid metabolic axis-a sequential reduction in UDP-galactose levels leading to diminished plasmalogen biosynthesis-providing direct molecular evidence for the pathogenic sequence in which disrupted glycolytic energy metabolism precipitates membrane structural dysfunction. This method not only markedly improves the consistency and throughput of omics data but also lays a technical foundation for advancing precision diagnostics and treatment of diabetes from \"blood glucose management\" to \"metabolic network regulation.\"","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

A key consideration in developing targeted metabolomics methods using HPLC-MS/MS for human or animal plasma is whether to employ derivatization of amino acids, amino acid-related compounds, and biogenic amines. Derivatization with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) enhances ionization and LC-separation, but complicates sample preparation and introduces potential errors. This study focuses on (1) the validation of a PITC derivatization method employing reversed-phase (RP) HPLC-MS/MS analysis and (2) a comparison of two analytical approaches for targeted metabolomics analysis of animal and human plasma: the PITC derivatization-based RP-LC-MS/MS method and a \"dilute-and-shoot\" approach using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-MS/MS and RP-LC-MS/MS analysis. The derivatization method was validated for porcine plasma, assessing limits of detection, lower limits of quantification (LLOQs), linearity, repeatability, recovery, and trueness. Derivatization reduced LLOQs for derivatized compounds in pure solvent solutions but, due to higher dilution factors, resulted in similar LLOQs for derivatized compounds and higher LLOQs for non-derivatized compounds in plasma compared to the \"dilute-and-shoot\" method. Derivatization improved chromatographic separation of isomers and reduced carryover but introduced challenges such as matrix effects, coelution with impurities, and calibration issues. The \"dilute-and-shoot\" method performed better for non-derivatized compounds and was less error-prone. Both methods were applied to plasma from various species, demonstrating comparable concentrations for most metabolites. The results also emphasize the importance of using different approaches for cross-validation. Above all, this study highlights the strengths and limitations of both the derivatization method and the \"dilute-and-shoot\" approach, providing guidance for their application in targeted metabolomics.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Results showed that QZC significantly alleviated the physiological symptoms of HP, with remarkable restoration of the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein. It can also reverse pathological changes in liver function to healthy levels. Besides, metabolomic analysis identified 24 metabolites as biomarkers which are highly related to HP. All the markers were settled back to normal with the intervention of QZC. Seventy-seven compounds originated from QZC were found in blood; 17 of them were highly related to the trajectory change of biomarkers of HP. These compounds were the potential effective constituents related to its clinical efficacy, such as Emodin et&#xa0;al. These ingredients regulated the biomarker farnesol to target Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) involved in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism with HP.

Ross broiler chicks were challenged with E. coli at 3 or 5 d of age, and blood samples collected at 8 and 24&#xa0;h following infection. Serum samples were analyzed for metabolite alterations using targeted The Metabolomics Innovation Centre (TMIC) mega metabolomics assay.

Metabolomics, leveraging mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, offers a comprehensive and functional readout of tumor biochemistry. By enabling both targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted profiling, metabolomics captures the dynamic metabolic alterations associated with cancer. The integration of metabolomics with machine learning (ML) approaches further enhances the interpretation of these complex, high-dimensional datasets, providing powerful insights into cancer biology from biomarker discovery to therapeutic targeting. This review systematically examines the transformative role of ML in cancer metabolomics. We discuss how various ML methodologies-including supervised algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest), unsupervised techniques (e.g., Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE), and deep learning frameworks-are advancing cancer research. Specifically, we highlight three major applications of ML-metabolomics integration: (1) cancer subtyping, exemplified by the use of Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) and LASSO regression to classify triple-negative breast cancer into subtypes with distinct survival outcomes; (2) biomarker discovery, where Random Forest and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models have achieved &gt;90% accuracy in detecting breast and colorectal cancers through biofluid metabolomics; and (3) prognostic modeling, demonstrated by the identification of race-specific metabolic signatures in breast cancer and the prediction of clinical outcomes in lung and ovarian cancers. Beyond these areas, we explore applications across prostate, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers, where ML-driven metabolomics is contributing to earlier detection, improved risk stratification, and personalized treatment planning. We also address critical challenges, including issues of data quality (e.g., batch effects, missing values), model interpretability, and barriers to clinical translation. Emerging solutions, such as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches and standardized multi-omics integration pipelines, are discussed as pathways to overcome these hurdles. By synthesizing recent advances, this review illustrates how ML-enhanced metabolomics bridges the gap between fundamental cancer metabolism research and clinical application, offering new avenues for precision oncology through improved diagnosis, prognosis, and tailored therapeutic strategies.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

The mobile phase system used was 0.1 % formic acid-methanol. Positive and negative ions are scanned simultaneously, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used for detection. The results revealed that the linear correlation coefficients (r) of the 17 metabolic substances were all greater than 0.99 within the linear range of 1-100 &#x3bc;g/L. Most of the substances had matrix inhibition effect. The recoveries ranged from 85.1 to 114.7 %, and the relative standard deviations (RSD) ranged from 1.3 to 13.3 %. The LOD and LOQ were set as 0.05 mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg respectively. The culture metabolism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens were analyzed. Pyocyanin, 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ), phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) and 1-hydroxyphenazine were found to be unique metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The actual sample determination results shows that the metabolic residual risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cosmetics is low. The simulation sample analysis results indicate that cosmetics can inhibit the metabolism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The HPLC-MS/MS method demonstrated high sensitivity, strong specificity, excellent selectivity, good accuracy and convenient operation. This study can provide technical support for the applied research on Pseudomonas aeruginosa metabolism and risk screening of residual metabolites in cosmetics.

The incidence of renal insufficiency is 10%-40% at 3-7 years after transplantation. This study aims to conduct metabolic profiling of serum samples from heart transplantation recipients to uncover differential metabolites related to renal insufficiency and potential pathogenic mechanisms. A total of 101 heart transplantation recipients were included and categorized into three groups according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate. The demographic and clinical data were collected at the time of sample collection. Plasma samples were collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The untargeted metabolomics revealed that during the progression of renal injury, 35 metabolites were upregulated and 1 metabolite was downregulated. Among them, the univariate analysis demonstrated that 13 differential metabolites had AUC &#x2265; 0.80 in both Stage 3 versus Stage 1 and Stage 3 versus Stage 2. Furthermore, enriched pathway analysis revealed that the differential metabolites among the three groups are mainly associated with ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, protein digestion and absorption, and biosynthesis of amino acids. Our findings indicate a strong association between creatinine and 5-aminolevulinic acid with the occurrence and progression of renal insufficiency following heart transplantation.

In contrast, SSc showed distinct perturbations in inositol and amino acid metabolism linked to fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. Significantly elevated levels of acetate emerged as a key discriminatory metabolite in SSc patients, implying a shift towards enhanced fatty acid oxidation in SSc, potentially fueling fibrotic processes and contributing to the energy demands of chronic inflammation. Specific metabolic ratios (with acetate as the numerator) demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing SSc from SLE and HC, highlighting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers; including multivariate and multiclass ROC, supported the diagnostic relevance of these markers.

Conventional surveillance with imaging and serum markers (CA15-3, CEA) lacks the sensitivity and specificity to detect minimal residual disease. This narrative review examines non-invasive biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and exosomes and the technologies enhancing their performance. Droplet digital PCR and next-generation sequencing detect ctDNA at allele frequencies below 0.1%, identifying molecular relapse a median of 10-12 months before radiologic progression. Microfluidic and affinity-based platforms isolate CTCs with over 75% sensitivity in metastatic settings. Nanoengineered sensors and standardized workflows improve exosome isolation, revealing miRNA and protein signatures predictive of recurrence. Proteomic and metabolomic profiling identify dysregulated metabolic pathways and protein networks, offering functional insights that complement molecular assays. Integrative multi-omics approaches merge genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data; machine-learning frameworks detect subtle patterns and correlations, enabling dynamic, personalized surveillance. By detecting molecular and functional biomarkers early, clinicians can tailor therapy, monitor treatment response and intervene promptly. Challenges include low analyte abundance, assay variability, high costs and lack of standardized protocols, limiting clinical adoption. Prospective validation in large cohorts is critical. We highlight ongoing clinical trials such as ctDNA-guided adjuvant therapy and CTC-driven stratification studies that aim to establish clinical utility.

Unfortunately, there are no specific laboratory tests available for the early diagnosis of PD, and the cure is on hold. Given the heterogeneity of PD and overlapping symptoms with other disorders, one biomarker may not be sufficient for accurate diagnosis. Dopamine transporter imaging tests may be useful in diagnosis, but their utility is limited by factors such as availability, sensitivity, and resolution. Recent advances in testing, particularly those involving alpha-synuclein seed amplification, have shown promise. Given the heterogeneity of PD and overlapping symptoms with other disorders, one biomarker may not be sufficient for accurate diagnosis. Instead, a biomarker panel potentially incorporating multi-omics approaches will be needed. This panel should integrate various biomarkers derived from neuroimaging, oxidative stress, neuroprotection, and inflammation, tested from brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, urine, and saliva. Multi-omics approaches and utilizing the exosomes could be beneficial, as exosomes protect their cargo from extracellular degradation and play a role in paracrine signaling that may contribute to disease progression.

In this prospective study, 200 patients undergoing ICI therapy were enrolled, of whom 59 underwent longitudinal metabolomic profiling at baseline, three months, and six months. Thirty-two patients who developed irAE were compared to 27 age- and sex-matched individuals without irAE.

This study investigated gut microbiota and metabolic profiles of breast cancer patients before and after adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET). Using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics, we identified significant disruptions in microbial diversity and metabolic pathways. Alpha diversity was reduced in pre-AET patients, with partial restoration observed post-AET. Key genera, such as <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Coprococcus</i>, were enriched in pre-AET patients, whereas <i>Proteus</i> and <i>Methylobacterium</i> were enriched in post-AET patients. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant reductions in the levels of vitamin B6 metabolites in both the pre-AET and post-AET groups compared to those in the healthy control (HC) group, indicating potential nutrient deficiencies or metabolic stress. Elevated cholesterol and estrogen metabolite levels in pre-AET patients reflect dysregulated lipid and hormone metabolism, with post-AET decreases in estrogen metabolites, confirming therapeutic efficacy. Correlation analysis revealed that <i>Klebsiella_724518</i> was positively correlated with estrogen and vitamin B6 metabolites, whereas <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Methylobacterium</i>, <i>Treponema_D</i>, and <i>Holdemanella</i> were negatively correlated with cholesterol.

Li exposure triggered oxidative stress in the liver of Nile tilapia fish, as demonstrated by increased levels of hydrogen peroxide (H&#x2082;O&#x2082;), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), and malondialdehyde (MDA). This was accompanied by significant biochemical alterations, including elevated activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), alongside a reduction in reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Furthermore, exposure to Li led to increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and protein carbonyl (PCO) content, reflecting intensified oxidative damage and protein oxidation. A significant reduction in saturated fatty acids (SFA) was observed, coupled with an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in all Li-treated fish. Notably, there was a substantial rise in n-3 PUFA levels, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3), which correlated with increased activity of &#x394;4 and &#x394;5 desaturases.

In this study, we conducted an integrated multi-omics analysis to characterize the functional signatures of gut microbiome in AS. We collected all public AS-related 6 microbiome datasets and 8 peripheral blood host transcriptomic datasets from across the world, comprising 456 metagenomic samples and 111 16S rRNA gene sequencing samples for microbial profiling, alongside 118 RNA-Seq samples and 302 microarray samples. We systematically characterized AS microbial taxa and computationally inferred the metabolic potential for the gut microbiome using metabolomic-related data. Metabolite-host gene interactions were further predicted based on the synergistic effects between microbiome and host transcriptome in AS. Five \"microbe-metabolite-host gene\" tripartite associations related to AS were identified involving 5 microbial genera (<i>Actinomyces</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Eisenbergiella</i>, <i>Gemella</i>, and <i>Veillonella</i>), 2 metabolites (Ethanol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and 2&#xa0;host genes (FANCD2 and GPX2), and the reliability of these associations was validated.

However, high donor variability remains a challenge for biomarker identification. This work unveiled shared lipid features of human adipose-tissue MSC (hAMSC) for three independent donors, using an untargeted NMR spectroscopy methodology. The results showed that osteodifferentiation induced increases in esterified cholesterol preferentially enriched in shorter monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and triacylglycerides containing longer fatty acids (FA), both consistent with increased lipid droplet formation in the cytosol. Membrane adaptations involved hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), possibly to allow subsequent polyunsaturated FA incorporation (to enhance membrane fluidity) and facilitate removal of peroxidized FA, while originating inorganic phosphate (Pi) for mineralization. PtdCho levels seem closely linked to the creatine-phosphocreatine axis, reflecting a shared contribution to Pi generation. MUFA also appeared to serve as preferential substrates for &#x3b2;-oxidation, apparently in association with antioxidative mechanisms. The above metabolic effects were indicative of a common pathway modulation in the three donors, with predicted upregulation of ALP, collagen, antioxidant enzymes, LDL, and HSP27, and downregulation of ERK 1/2 (notably upregulated at day 7), arginase, and vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.

Previous toxicological and in silico results suggested that developmental effects are associated with analogous chemical exposure; however, the key molecular events and underlying mechanisms remain unclear, especially in the early stages of aquatic organisms. In the present study, a zebrafish larval model was used to comprehensively assess the developmental toxicity of BCAcAm via transcriptional, metabolic, biochemical and morphological tests. Integration analyses of RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomic data revealed crucial biological processes related to drug metabolism, cardiac muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation, which started from the initial stage, and ferroptosis progressed to the advanced stage in validated cardiac defects. Biochemical assays further verified ATP depletion, ROS and MDA accumulation, and hyperactivation of detoxification (increased GST activity) and the antioxidative system (increased GSH and GSSG levels). Transcriptionally, BCAcAm led to gpx4 downregulation, iron homeostasis perturbation (upregulated tfr and tf and downregulated fth) and lipid peroxidation (elevated alox12 and lpcat3), suggesting the involvement of ferroptosis. Moreover, the application of Fer-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) reversed BCAcAm-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cardiotoxicity.

Kopyor displays notable phenotypic diversity in terms of cultivar and endosperm quantity (EQ), which refers to the amount of flesh detached from the endocarp. Despite its distinct traits, kopyor utilization is limited because of the lack of comprehensive research on its diverse phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the variations of metabolites and nutrients in kopyors by analyzing metabolomic profiles, physicochemical properties, and proximate characteristics across three cultivars with EQ levels ranging from 10 % to 50 %. The results showed that EQ influenced metabolite accumulation more significantly than the cultivar did. Elevated levels of EQ have been associated with increased concentrations of essential amino acids, which are classified as sensory-related metabolites. An increase in EQ was accompanied by the breakdown of macromolecules, particularly carbohydrates and proteins into simpler sugars and amino acids. This process potentially enhanced the bioavailability of nutrients in kopyor coconuts compared to that in normal coconuts. This study proposed potential metabolite marker for assessing the quality of kopyor coconuts. Valine, an essential amino acid, was the only compound consistently and significantly detected across all analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA), F-test, Tukey's test, Pearson correlation, and orthogonal projections to latent structures regression (OPLSR), conducted on the water and flesh of kopyor coconuts.

For multiclass classification, XGBoost with Kruskal-Wallis-selected features achieved 77% accuracy, while one-versus-one CNN models utilizing Mann-Whitney-selected features attained 78% accuracy, demonstrating optimal performance among tested approaches. The complementary strengths of deep learning and ensemble methods underscore their potential for tailored diagnostic applications. While clinical implementation requires further standardization, these findings provide both a methodological framework for metabolic biomarker discovery and biological insights into OC pathophysiology, paving the way for integrated multi-omics approaches in gynecologic oncology.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Clinical biochemistry from the plasma was assessed, and the histopathological changes of the intestines were evaluated. Metabolomics was performed to explore the intestinal metabolomic profiles from the Uox-Ko mice, and the potential metabolic biomarkers were identified.

To fulfill these expectations, metabolome changes need an accurate characterization under several well-characterized physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The aim of the present work is to study mammary quarters of dairy cows affected by subclinical mastitis (SCM) and acute inflammation compared to healthy animals. The milk metabolome was investigated by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy and by the assessment of somatic cell populations by flow cytometry using a panel of leukocyte markers (CD11b, CD44, CD14, CD4, CD8, CD21). The study was integrated by microbiological evaluations and oxidized proteins (AOPP) determination and results were analyzed by multivariate model. Mammary quarters with the highest CD11b positive cells, suggestive of acute inflammation, were present in SCM-affected cows only, and were characterized by significantly higher AOPP, where the microbiological analysis revealed the presence of minor pathogens. A good PCA separation between healthy and SCM-infected animals was observed (overall error rate: 0.177&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.056) confirming that SCC are associated with modifications of milk metabolome. The classification accuracy was lower (overall error rate: 0.343&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.029) when the mammary quarters were classified on the fraction of CD11b positive cells of quarters from healthy and SCM-affected cows. Interestingly, low-CD11b-SCM samples tended to be misclassified (error rate: 0.460), suggesting the influence of infected neighboring quarters. The results of this work underlay the importance of studying the functional interdependence of mammary quarters in animals affected by SCM. SIMPLE SUMMARY: This study explored how subclinical mastitis-a mild, often hidden udder infection in dairy cows-affects the metabolites in milk. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used for comparing milk from healthy cows to that produced by cows with subclinical mastitis caused by bacterial infections. We found that the metabolic profile (metabolome) of analyzed milk changed noticeably in infected cows. These changes were linked to both immune cell activity and possible damage to udder tissue. Surprisingly, even parts of the udder that seemed healthy in infected cows sometimes showed altered milk composition. This suggests that infections in one part of the udder can influence nearby quarters or cause broader changes in the cow's immune and metabolic systems. The findings support the suggestion that milk metabolites could be used to detect early stages of udder infections. The study also highlights how different quarters of the udder are connected, and how even the \"healthy\" ones can be affected when a cow suffers from mastitis.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Differential metabolites in plasma samples from oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma patients and healthy volunteers were screened, and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was performed via pseudo-targeted metabolomics. Based on the significantly enriched metabolic pathways and related literature, 20 amino acids were selected and targeted for quantitative analysis. The key parameters for extraction recovery, including the type of liquid in the adsorption system, pH of the eluent, amount of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub>, and time of extraction and elution, were optimized based on the selected amino acids. The optimized method demonstrated a remarkable performance: correlation coefficients &gt; 0.99, limits of detection ranging from 0.002 to 0.080 &#xb5;g/mL (signal-to-noise ratio = 10), and recoveries of 63.9%-110.8% in plasma samples. Thus, via targeted metabolomics analysis, 10 amino acids (including lysine and 3-iodo-L-tyrosine) and 10 amino acids (including arginine and histidine) were determined as potential biomarkers for oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Based on the above potential amino acid markers, discriminant equations for oral squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma were established, respectively. Two biomarker combinations were successfully screened: lysine and 3-iodo-L-tyrosine (AUC = 0.998, sensitivity = 0.967, specificity = 1.0) for oral squamous cell carcinoma, and histidine and arginine (AUC = 0.944, sensitivity = 0.833, specificity = 0.933) for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Here we propose a workflow to integrate multiassay metabolomics data, designed to enable biomarker discovery and elucidation of unknown metabolites. We employ a multiblock-partial least-squares model (MB-PLS) coupled with multiblock variable importance in projection to estimate the importance of predictors to the outcome variable. Then we cluster the selected predictors and compare them to groups defined by their structural properties based on retention time and mass-to-charge ratio. To demonstrate and evaluate the approach, we used three multiassay data sets predicting biological sex, Alzheimer's disease status, and blood bilirubin levels as the outcomes of interest. The MB-PLS models outperformed single-assay models in both classification and regression tasks, indicating that modeling interblock relationships enabled an improved estimate of phenotypic outcome. Additionally, the MB-PLS models shed valuable insight into each data block's contribution to the predicted outcome. Our workflow enabled us to determine a set of potential cross-assay biomarkers. Following putative annotation, the majority of these and their signs of association agreed with results previously reported in the literature.

Self-organizing map analysis revealed distinct metabolic signatures for each subtype, highlighting critical pathways. Group 1 (ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative) exhibited elevated serine, tyrosine, and 2-aminoadipic acid levels, indicating enhanced amino acid metabolism supporting nucleotide synthesis and redox balance. Group 3 (triple-negative breast cancer) displayed increased TCA cycle intermediates, such as &#x3b1;-ketoglutarate and malate, reflecting a metabolic shift toward energy production and biosynthesis to sustain aggressive proliferation. In Group 4 (HER2-enriched), elevated phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines suggested upregulated mono-unsaturated phospholipid biosynthesis.

Early detection significantly improves survival rates, but traditional biomarkers like CA 15-3 and HER2 lack sensitivity and specificity, particularly for early-stage disease. Advances in metabolomics and machine learning, particularly explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offer new opportunities for identifying robust biomarkers and improving diagnostic accuracy. This study aimed to identify and validate serum-based metabolic biomarkers for breast cancer using advanced metabolomic profiling techniques and a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to enhance model interpretability and biological insight. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> The study included 103 breast cancer patients and 31 healthy controls. Serum samples underwent liquid and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS and GC-TOFMS). Mutual Information (MI), Sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Boruta, and Multi-Objective Feature Selection (MOFS) approaches were applied to the data for biomarker discovery. LightGBM, AdaBoost, and Random Forest were employed for classification and to identify class imbalance with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). SHAP analysis ranked metabolites based on their contribution to model predictions. <i>Results:</i> Compared to other feature selection approaches, the MOFS approach was more robust in terms of predictive performance, and metabolites identified by this method were used in subsequent analyses for biomarker discovery. LightGBM outperformed the AdaBoost and Random Forest models, achieving 86.6% accuracy, 89.1% sensitivity, 84.2% specificity, and an F1-score of 87.0%. SHAP analysis identified 2-Aminobutyric acid, choline, and coproporphyrin as the most influential metabolites, with dysregulation of these markers associated with breast cancer risk. <i>Conclusions:</i> This study is among the first to integrate SHAP explainability with metabolomic profiling, bridging computational predictions and biological insights for improved clinical adoption.

The relative integrals of these resonances provide clear indication of the unique metabolic changes associated with disease, specifically inflammatory conditions, often related to serious diseases such as cancer or COVID-19 infection. Relatively complicated, yet very efficient experimental methods have been introduced recently (DIRE, JEDI) to suppress the rest of the spectrum, thus allowing measurement of these integrals of interest. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, we introduce a simple alternative processing method using CRAFT (Complete Reduction to Amplitude-Frequency Table), a time-domain (FID) analysis tool which can highlight selected subsets of the spectrum by choice for quantitative analysis. The output of this approach is a direct, spreadsheet-based representation of the required peak amplitude (integral) values, ready for comparative analysis, completely avoiding all the convectional data processing and manipulation steps. The significant advantage of this alternative method is that it only needs a simple water-suppressed 1D spectrum with no further experimental manipulation whatsoever.

This study compared metabolite concentrations in serum samples between 13 children with asthma and IgE-dependent allergy and 10 without asthma and IgE-dependent allergy, aged between 6 months and 5 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included a total of 23 children. The targeted metabolomic analysis was performed using an AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit and analyzed using a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer coupled with a high-performance liquid chromatograph. Statistical analyses included univariate tests and univariate and multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS Of the 188 metabolites, 131 were determined in the samples. Additionally, 48 sums and ratios of metabolites were calculated. Significant differences (P&lt;0.05) were found for the 6 metabolites of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids and ratio serotonin synthesis. Multivariate ROC curve analysis was performed for phosphatidylcholine 40: 4 and serotonin synthesis ratio, which were selected based on the univariate ROC curve analysis results.

Here, we compare three acquisition modes-Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA), Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA), and AcquireX -to evaluate performance and reproducibility in detecting low-abundance metabolites in a complex matrix. A system suitability test (SST) based on 14 eicosanoid standards was implemented to evaluate the suitability of our instrumental setup prior to conducting untargeted metabolomics analyses and monitor long-term system performance. Bovine liver total Lipid Extract (TLE) was spiked with decreasing levels (10-0.01&#x202f;ng/mL) of the eicosanoid standard mix (StdMix) to compare the detection power of each mode. Reproducibility was evaluated over three independent measurements, spaced one week apart. Chromatographic separation was performed on a C18-Kinetex Core-Shell column and HRAM-MS/MS data were acquired using an Orbitrap Exploris 480. DIA detected and identified the highest number of metabolic features, (averaging 1036 metabolic features over three measurements), followed by DDA (18&#x202f;% fewer) and AcquireX (37&#x202f;% fewer). Moreover, DIA demonstrated superior reproducibility, with a coefficient of variance of 10&#x202f;% across detected compounds over three measurements, compared to 17&#x202f;% for DDA and 15&#x202f;% for AcquireX. DIA further exhibited better compound identification consistency, with 61&#x202f;% overlap between two days, compared to DDA (43&#x202f;%) and AcquireX (50&#x202f;%). DIA reproduced fragmentation spectra patterns with high consistency, contributing to higher reproducibility in compound identification.

At low spiking levels, 0.1 and 0.01&#x202f;ng/mL, a general cut-off was observed for the three acquisition modes. None of this assessed acquisition modes was able to detect and/or identify eicosanoids at physiologically relevant concentrations, explaining their frequent omission in routine untargeted analyses.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Transcriptomic analysis of GEO datasets via weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) and differential expression revealed critical pathways associated with MAFLD progression. Subsequently, LC-MS/MS-based widely targeted metabolomics and lipidomics were conducted on plasma samples from 40 healthy controls and 120 patients with MAFLD at varying stages of severity (40 mild, 40 moderate, and 40 severe). Machine learning algorithms (LASSO regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and XGBoost) were then applied to these datasets to identify critical biomarkers linked to disease severity. Ultimately, a biomarker panel comprising 5-aminolevulinic acid, mesaconic acid, shikimic acid, PC O-35:3, and PI 36:2 exhibited outstanding diagnostic performance in detecting the prevalence and severity of MAFLD, achieving an accuracy of 88.3% in the training cohort and over 91.7% prediction accuracy in the independent test cohort.

The hepatic injury in SD rats was assessed by body weight, liver weight/index, biochemical index, L-glutathione(GSH), malondialdehyde(MDA), and pathological alterations. The qPCR was utilized to determine the expression of metabolic enzymes in the liver and inflammatory factors. Differential metabolites were screened using principal component analysis(PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis(PLS-DA), followed by a metabolic pathway analysis. The Mantel test was performed to assess differential metabolites and abnormally expressed biochemical indexes, obtaining potential biomarkers. The high-dose ADC group showed a decrease in body weight and an increase in liver weight and index, resulting in hepatic inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic steatosis.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism reprogramming specific to LUSC remain poorly understood. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying and characterizing EHHADH (enoyl-CoA, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) as a key regulator of medium-chain fatty acid metabolism in LUSC. The peroxisomal L-bifunctional enzyme is one of the important elements to control the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Through high-expression genes related to lipid metabolism were identified by data mining, the expression and regulatory effects of EHHADH in different cell lines were investigated. EHHADH was highly expressed in LUSC cells and exhibited different expression patterns from those in LUAD cells. Knockdown of EHHADH in LUSC cell lines led to a marked reduction in cell proliferation. RNA sequencing following EHHADH silencing demonstrated significant changes in the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes in different cell lines, such as AZGP1, CAV1, CYP3A4, NR2F2, NR3C2, and RARG. Lipidomics analysis further demonstrated that EHHADH plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular and extracellular lipid profiles. EHHADH knockdown resulted in increased levels of long-chain fatty acids and storage lipids, while decreased levels of medium-chain fatty acids. Conversely, overexpression of EHHADH reduced long-chain fatty acids and storage lipids, while increasing specific medium-chain fatty acids. These metabolic alterations were consistent with changes in lipid metabolism-related protein expression, supporting the molecular mechanistic role of EHHADH in lipid regulation. In conclusion, EHHADH functions as an important regulator of lipid metabolism in LUSC and plays a key role in the occurrence, progression, and treatment of lung cancer. The important impact of EHHADH in lipid metabolism disorders suggests potential utility as a biomarker for diagnosis and a target for personalized treatment strategies in lung cancer.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Metabolomics approaches, which are high-throughput profiling of small molecule metabolites in plasma or serum in RA patients, have so far provided biomarker discovery in the literature for clinical subgroups, risk factors, and predictors of treatment response using classical statistical approaches or machine learning models. Despite these recent developments, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based methodology has not been used to identify RA metabolomic biomarkers and distinguish patients with RA. This study constructed a XAI-based EBM model using global plasma metabolomics profiling to identify metabolites predictive of RA patients and to develop a classification model that can distinguish RA patients from healthy controls. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Global plasma metabolomics data were analysed from RA patients (49 samples) and healthy individuals (10 samples). SMOTE technique was used for class imbalance in data preprocessing. EBM, LightGBM, and AdaBoost algorithms were applied to generate a discriminatory model between RA and controls. Comprehensive performance metrics were calculated, and the interpretability of the optimal model was assessed using global and local feature descriptions. <i>Results</i>: A total of 59 samples were analysed, 49 from RA patients, and 10 from healthy subjects. The EBM generated better results than LightGBM and AdaBoost by attaining an AUC of 0.901 (95% CI: 0.847-0.955) with 87.8% sensitivity which helps prevent false negative early RA diagnosis. The primary biomarkers EBM-based XAI identified were <i>N</i>-acetyleucine, pyruvic acid, and glycerol-3-phosphate. EBM global explanation analysis indicated that elevated pyruvic acid levels were significantly correlated with RA, whereas <i>N</i>-acetyleucine exhibited a nonlinear relationship, implying possible protective effects at specific concentrations. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study underscores the promise of XAI and evidence-based medicine methodology in developing biomarkers for RA through metabolomics. The discovered metabolites offer significant insights into RA pathophysiology and may function as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Incorporating EBM methodologies integrated with XAI improves model transparency and increases the therapeutic applicability of predictive models for RA diagnosis/management. Furthermore, the transparent structure of the EBM model empowers clinicians to understand and verify the reasoning behind each prediction, thereby fostering trust in AI-assisted decision-making and facilitating the integration of metabolomic insights into routine clinical practice.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Four-day food records and 7-day dietary screeners of 51 Finnish children aged 1-7 years, consuming a vegan (n = 7), pesco-/lacto-/ovo-vegetarian (n = 11) or omnivorous diet (n = 33), were used for assessing general performance of ASEP as diet measure. Blood samples of 40 children (six vegans, eight vegetarians, 26 omnivores) were analyzed for plasma LDL cholesterol, erythrocyte folate concentration and serum untargeted MS-metabolomics. Estimated ASEPs varied between 0% and 52%. Vegetarians and omnivores showed overlapping ASEPs. ASEP had a strong positive correlation with saturated fatty acid (percent of energy, E%; r = 0.785) and cholesterol intake (r = 0.715) and a strong negative correlation with fibre (r = -&#xa0;0.811) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (E%; r = -&#xa0;0.819) intake. ASEP also correlated with plasma LDL cholesterol (r = 0.699) concentration. Serum indoleacrylic acid (IAA) is suggested to be further investigated as a possible biomarker of plant-forward diet.

Despite advances in supportive care, accurate prediction of ARDS mortality remains challenging, resulting in delayed delivery of targeted interventions and effective disease management. Traditional critical illness severity scores lack specificity for ARDS, underscoring the need for more precise prognostic tools for ARDS mortality. To address this crucial gap, we employed a multimodal approach to predict ARDS patients utilizing a comprehensive dataset comprised of integrated clinical, metabolomic, and biochemical/cytokine data from ARDS patients (collected within hours of ICU admission) to develop and validate predictive models of ARDS mortality risk. The most robust multimodal data model generated demonstrated superior predictive capability with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.868 on the test set and 0.959 on the validation set. Notably, this model achieved perfect specificity in identifying non-survivors in the validation cohort, highlighting potential utility in guiding early and targeted interventions in ICU settings. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant alterations in crucial pathways associated with ARDS mortality with tryptophan metabolism, particularly the kynurenine pathway, emerging as the most significantly enriched metabolic route, as well as the NAD+ metabolism/nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis pathways. These metabolic derangements were strongly confirmed by lipidomic/metabolomic analysis of lung tissues from a porcine sepsis/ARDS model. Together, these findings demonstrate the promise of integrating multimodal data to improve ARDS prognostication and to provide important insights into the complex metabolic derangements underlying severe ARDS. Identification of metabolic signatures, such as kynurenine and NAD+ metabolism/NAMPT pathways, may serve as a foundation for developing personalized and effective targeted interventions and management strategies for ARDS patients.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

In here, metabolomic and lipidomic parameters obtained by a standardized and targeted in vitro diagnostic research (IVDr) platform have a significant potential to address therapy-related questions and generate improved biomarker panels. Our study aimed to use IVDr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantify metabolites and lipoproteins in PD blood serum from different cohorts to stratify metabolically driven subtypes of idiopathic and genetic PD. Serum aliquots from three neurodegeneration biobank cohorts (287 samples in total, including 62 PD patient samples with GBA mutation, 98/43 PD patient samples of early/late stages of disease duration, 20 PD samples from patients with mutations in recessive PD genes and some smaller subgroups of mitochondrial and double mutation cases) were prepared and analyzed with IVDr NMR spectroscopy, covering 39 blood serum metabolites and 112 lipoprotein parameters. Uni- and multivariate statistics were used to identify metabolism-driven changes under consideration of typical confounders such as age, sex and disease duration and set into context with clinical biomarkers such as CSF concentrations of alpha-synuclein, neurofilament light chain, and tau protein. Based on the different PD subgroups we performed a total of eight different comparisons. Highlights from these comparisons include increased citrate and dimethylglycine with a decrease of creatinine and methionine in healthy controls and early PD group compared to GBA, PD late and recessive PD. We furthermore identified decreased HDL-3 free cholesterol in genetic PD cases compared to sporadic subject samples (sum of the PD early and PD late groups). Considering medication, we found that the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) is mostly positively correlated with tyrosine and citrate in sporadic PD compared to pyruvate and phenylalanine in genetic PD. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alpha-synuclein were negatively correlated with alanine. Further metabolites and lipoproteins with discriminatory power for double mutation PD cases involved ornithine, 2-aminobutyrate and 2-hydroxybutyrate as well as for mitochondrial phenotypes via LDL phospholipid, apolipoprotein and cholesterol subfractions. Quantitative IVDr NMR serum spectroscopy is able to stratify PD patient samples of different etiology and can contribute to a wider understanding of the underlying metabolism-driven alterations e.g. in energy, amino acid, and lipoprotein metabolism. Though our overall cohort was large, major confounders such as age, sex and medication have a strong impact. That is why absolute quantification and detailed patient knowledge about metabolic confounders, is a premise for future translation of NMR serum spectroscopy to routine PD diagnostics.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

One approach involves&#xa0;the use of endogenous substrates of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) as biomarkers, which can assess the inhibitory potential of new chemical entities towards DMET during Phase 1 clinical studies. Thus, biomarkers could potentially eliminate the need for dedicated DDI studies with exogenous probe substrates. Metabolomics, in conjunction with in vitro and/or in vivo preclinical models or clinical studies, can be used for biomarker discovery. We developed and applied a novel metabolomics-based DMET biomarker discovery (MDBD) approach to identify and qualify biomarkers of renal organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) and OAT3. Untargeted metabolomics of pooled plasma and urine samples (n = 16) from a pharmacokinetic DDI study using the OAT1/3 inhibitor, probenecid, yielded 153 features identified as putative OAT1/3 biomarkers. Subsequently, in vitro transporter uptake assays using processed urine samples confirmed 57 of these features as OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates. Finally, 23 features were clinically validated as OAT1/3 biomarkers through a detailed pharmacokinetic analysis (0-24&#x2009;h) of plasma and urine samples (n = 4). These biomarkers, either alone or as part of a panel, can predict OAT1/3-mediated DDIs and interindividual variability in the renal secretory clearance of organic anions across different populations, thereby enabling translational utility in clinical settings.

Hybrid grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x Epinephelus lanceolatus) is a marine carnivorous teleost that has a high economic importance in the marine aquaculture industry particularly in countries in the Asian region. However, the vulnerability of juvenile hybrid grouper to temperature fluctuations stemming from the acceleration of climate change is regarded as one of significant threats to their market supply and a major concern for the aquaculture industry. In the present study, LCMS/MS-based mucus and sera metabolomics were used to investigate the physiological responses of juvenile hybrid grouper via their behavioural response towards temperature fluctuation stress that could be translated as indicators for either resilience or susceptibility to the stressors. Susceptible fish exhibited pronounced behavioural responses, including cessation of feeding and erratic swimming. In contrast, resilient fish displayed relatively stable behaviour, comparable to control fish, with reduced feeding as a primary deviation. A total of 36 mucus metabolites (VIP&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1) were profiled in OPLSDA in juvenile hybrid grouper subjected to temperature fluctuation stress. Among these, 20 and 16 metabolites were significantly altered (Student's t-test, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) in susceptible (MSG) and resilient (MRG) fish in comparison to the control (CG), respectively. Although OPLSDA did not reveal a clear separation between the two groups, 4 metabolites namely glycerophosphocholine, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and pantothenic acid differed significantly between them. In sera, 54 metabolites (VIP&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;1) were profiled, with 38 and 26 significantly altered in the susceptible (SSG) and resilient (SRG) groups, respectively. Comparative analysis between significant and resilient groups resulted in the nomination of hypoxanthine, guanosine, guanine, methionine, DL-malic acid, and glucose as potential biomarkers for susceptibility in juvenile hybrid grouper. Pathway analysis of these metabolite markers revealed that temperature stress mainly affected purine metabolism, TCA cycle, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. Overall, the findings of this study provide insights into the physiological regulation of juvenile hybrid grouper that are susceptible to temperature changes through their behavioural response, as well as a framework for future research.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

This study aimed to identify key biomarkers associated with superovulation outcomes in cows through serum metabolomics analysis. In this study, 36 induced estrus cows were selected, and the blood samples were collected at three time points: before FSH injection, before artificial insemination, and before embryo collection. Then, the cows were classified into high embryonic yield (HEY) and low embryonic yield (LEY) groups based on the total number of embryos. Furthermore, a serum untargeted metabolomics analysis of the two groups was conducted using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 372 embryos were collected. The metabolomics analysis revealed that 1,158 metabolites were detected, and 617 were annotated. In the before FSH injection samples, 121 differential metabolites were identified between the two groups. In the before artificial insemination samples, 129 differential metabolites were identified. In the before embryo collection samples, 201 differential metabolites were identified. A total of 11 differential metabolites were shared between the before FSH injection and before artificial insemination samples, while five differential metabolites were shared across all three samples. The majority of the differential metabolites were significantly enriched in pathways related to amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, digestive system secretion, and ovarian steroidogenesis.

Early symptoms are non-specific, and currently, there are no adequate strategies to identify this disease at an early stage when much higher survival rates can be expected. Ovarian carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease, with various histotypes originating from different cells and tissues, and is characterized by distinct somatic mutations, progression profiles, and treatment responses. Our study presents a targeted metabolomics approach, characterizing seven different ovarian (cancer-) cell lines according to their extracellular, intracellular, and RNA-derived modified nucleoside profiles. Moreover, these data were correlated with transcriptomics data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Modified nucleosides are excreted in higher amounts in cancer cell lines due to their altered DNA/RNA metabolism. This study shows that seven different ovarian cancer cell lines, representing different molecular subtypes, can be discriminated according to their specific nucleoside pattern. We suggest modified nucleosides as strong biomarker candidates for ovarian cancer with the potential for subtype-specific discrimination. Extracellular modified nucleosides have the highest potential in the distinguishing of cell lines between control cell lines and themselves, and represent the closest to a desirable, non-invasive biomarker, since they accumulate in blood and urine.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Additionally, a six-metabolite biomarker panel was identified, showing strong diagnostic potential with sensitivity and accuracy exceeding 89.1% for distinguishing HC from PDAC. When coupled with the serological marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), the integrated strategy delivered significantly improved diagnostic performance, achieving high accuracy ranging from 95.3% to 100% in distinguishing HR and PDAC patients from HC.

However, the wide range of glycerophospholipid contents, particularly the low-abundance species in actual biological samples, posed a challenge for comprehensive analysis. In this study, an iterative quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-ToF-MS/MS) method was established with the aim of comprehensively detecting glycerophospholipids. This method was a data acquisition strategy implemented through iterative analyses. In each iteration, ions detected in previous runs were excluded, allowing low-abundance glycerophospholipids that were missed by the usual analysis to be extensively detected by a simplified operational process. Using this strategy, 254 glycerophospholipids including 157 PCs, 67 PEs, 19 PGs, 9 PIs, 7 PSs and 5 PAs in rat brain samples were identified after four iterations, and the number of glycerophospholipid species increased by 93.9% compared to a single assay, significantly enhancing the coverage of glycerophospholipid detection. Furthermore, the characteristic fragmentation patterns of six glycerophospholipid subclasses were systematically summarized to improve the accuracy of qualitative identification. In addition, these patterns were also used to construct an ion pair database containing 254 glycerophospholipids, enabling targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis under the optimized high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) conditions. By comparing the changed glycerophospholipids of rat brains from the normal and cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury groups, 29 glycerophospholipids were recognized as the potential biomarkers for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, among which nine glycerophospholipids were particularly detected by four iterations.

Addressing this challenge requires innovative approaches to uncover genetic resources that support molecular breeding of salt-tolerant crops. In this study, a novel machine learning model, KANMB is introduced, designed to analyze integrated multi-omics data from the natural halophyte Spartina alterniflora under various NaCl concentrations. Using KANMB, 226 metabolic biomarkers significantly linked to salt stress responses, grounded in metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles are identified. These biomarkers correlate with metabolic pathways associated with salt tolerance, providing insight into the underlying biochemical mechanisms. A co-expression analysis further highlights the MYB gene SaMYB35 as a pivotal regulator in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway under salt stress. When overexpressed SaMYB35 in rice (ZH11) grown under high salinity, it triggers the upregulation of key flavonoid biosynthetic genes, elevates flavonoid content, and enhances salt tolerance compared to wild-type plants. The findings from this study offer a valuable genetic toolkit for breeding salt-tolerant cereal varieties and demonstrate the power of machine learning in accelerating biomarker discovery for stress resilience in non-model plant species.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Although various treatments are available for BC, most cancer-related deaths are due to incurable metastases. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of BC are crucial before metastasis. Mammography and ultrasonography are primarily used in the clinic for the initial identification and staging of BC; these methods are useful for general screening but have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Omics-based biomarkers, like metabolomics, can make early diagnosis much more accurate, make tracking the disease's progression more accurate, and help make personalized treatment plans that are tailored to each tumor's specific molecular profile. Metabolomics technology is a feasible and comprehensive method for early disease detection and biomarker identification at the molecular level. This research aimed to establish an interpretable predictive artificial intelligence (AI) model using plasma-based metabolomics panel data to identify potential biomarkers that distinguish BC individuals from healthy controls. <i>Methods</i>: A cohort of 138 BC patients and 76 healthy controls were studied. Plasma metabolites were examined using LC-TOFMS and GC-TOFMS techniques. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Random Forest (RF) were evaluated using performance metrics such as Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. ROC and Precision-Recall (PR) curves were generated for comparative analysis. The SHapley Additive Descriptions (SHAP) analysis evaluated the optimal prediction model for interpretability. <i>Results</i>: The RF algorithm showed improved accuracy (0.963 &#xb1; 0.043) and sensitivity (0.977 &#xb1; 0.051); however, LightGBM achieved the highest ROC AUC (0.983 &#xb1; 0.028).

PAH4 (sum of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), chrysene, benz[a]anthracene and benzo[b]fluoranthene) has been proposed as a marker to evaluate the occurrence of total PAHs. However, toxicity effects of exposure to PAH4 mixture and its toxicity differences with single PAH are little-known. Here, we systematically investigated the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of PAH4 and compare its toxicity with BaP using HepG2 cell model. Our results showed that BaP and PAH4 exposure induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Furthermore, both BaP and PAH4 activated P53 signaling pathway, leading to cell apoptosis, and disrupted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and induced lipid metabolism disorder. Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics indicated that BaP and PAH4 shared similar toxicity mechanisms, commonly affecting the metabolic pathways including glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Moreover, the integrated biomarker response (IBR) analysis demonstrated that BaP and PAH4 exhibited similar global toxicity on HepG2 cells. We further found that the toxicity effects of PAH4 could be partially alleviated by an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonist, indicating a potential role of AHR signaling in PAH4-induced hepatotoxicity.

Emerging evidence demonstrated that sulforaphane (SFN) exerts potent protective effects against DON-triggered cytotoxicity through multimodal mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the protective mechanism of SFN during DON exposure. Untargeted metabolomics of IPEC-J2 cells revealed a total of 399 differential metabolites between the DON and control group and 365 differential metabolites between the SFN + DON and DON group. KEGG enrichment was performed to investigate the potential regulatory pathways. The transcriptome identified a total of 1839 differential expression genes (DEGs) between DON and SFN + DON groups. This result indicated that DON exposure and SFN treatment have a profound impact on cellular metabolism and genes. Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome showed that spermine was a potential biomarker for SFN treatment. SFN increased spermine abundance by regulating genes in glutathione, beta-alanine, and arginine and proline metabolism pathways. Functional experiments demonstrated that spermine alleviated DON-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased cell viability, reduced ROS levels, restored mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x394;&#x3a8;m), and normalized antioxidant enzyme activity.

A comprehensive search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection for literature related to omics in tumor immunotherapy, up to August 2024. Bibliometric analyses, conducted using R version 4.3.3, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and Citespace 6.2, examined publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal distributions, keyword co-occurrence, and citation bursts. This analysis of 9,494 publications demonstrates rapid growth in omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research since 2019, with China leading in output (63% of articles) yet exhibiting limited multinational collaboration (7.9% vs. the UK's 61.8%). Keyword co-occurrence and citation burst analyses reveal evolving frontiers: early emphasis on \"PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade\" has transitioned toward \"machine learning,\" \"multi-omics,\" and \"lncRNA,\" reflecting a shift to predictive modeling and biomarker discovery. Multi-omics integration has facilitated the development of immune infiltration-based prognostic models, such as TIME subtypes, which have been validated across multiple tumor types, which inform clinical trial design (e.g. NCT06833723). Additionally, proteomic analysis of melanoma patients suggests that metabolic biomarkers, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, may stratify responders to PD-1 blockade therapy.

Factors contributing to this resilience remain unclear. Using 4,658 glaucoma cases and 113,040 controls in a cross-sectional study of the UK Biobank, we investigated whether plasma metabolites enhanced glaucoma prediction and if a metabolomic signature of resilience in high-genetic-risk individuals existed. Logistic regression models incorporating 168 NMR-based metabolites into PRS-based glaucoma assessments were developed, with multiple comparison corrections applied. While metabolites weakly predicted glaucoma (Area Under the Curve = 0.579), they offered marginal prediction improvement in PRS-only-based models (p=0.004). We identified a metabolomic signature associated with resilience in the top glaucoma PRS decile, with elevated glycolysis-related metabolites-lactate (p=8.8E-12), pyruvate (p=1.9E-10), and citrate (p=0.02)-linked to reduced glaucoma prevalence. These metabolites combined significantly modified the PRS-glaucoma relationship (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.011). Higher total resilience metabolite levels within the highest PRS quartile corresponded to lower glaucoma prevalence (Odds Ratio<sub>highest vs. lowest total resilience metabolite quartile</sub>=0.71, 95% Confidence Interval = 0.64-0.80). As pyruvate is a foundational metabolite linking glycolysis to tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and ATP generation, we pursued experimental validation for this putative resilience biomarker in a human-relevant <i>Mus musculus</i> glaucoma model. Dietary pyruvate mitigated elevated intraocular pressure (p=0.002) and optic nerve damage (p&lt;0.0003) in <i>Lmx1b<sup>V265D</sup></i> mice.

Elastic net regression achieved 83% accuracy in predicting lameness from samples collected after calving and 100% accuracy at the time of lameness. A total of 10 mass ions selected by different statistical methods showed potential to be considered predictors of lameness. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation of retinol metabolism after calving in cows that go on to develop lameness in that lactation.

Chemical-tagging reduces labor and costs by eliminating the need for internal standard preparation. However, the chromatographic deuterium effect (CDE) has persisted as a significant challenge. CDE poses a risk of data misinterpretation in metabolomics due to potential differences in matrix effects. Although the CDE mechanism has been partially elucidated, it has primarily been attributed to differences in hydrophobicity.

Therefore, identifying biomarkers for early sepsis diagnosis and improving patient prognosis are critical. This study recruited 59 sepsis patients and 35 healthy volunteers from the Department of Critical Care Medicine at Harbin Medical University Affiliated First Hospital between March and December 2021. Through a combination of non-targeted and targeted proteomics and metabolomics sequencing, along with various analytical methods, we initially identified and validated serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis. Our study found that SAA1 was significantly elevated in the sepsis group, demonstrating its diagnostic value for sepsis (AUC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.88-1).

However, the metabolic profile of central carbon in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. We employed targeted metabolomics to analyze the alterations in central carbon metabolites present in the blood of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Models constructed using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were utilized to evaluate intergroup differences in metabolite levels. Furthermore, a public database facilitated the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Additionally, metabolites exhibiting significant differences were selected, and their effects on the proliferation and drug resistance of human myeloid leukemia cell lines were validated in vitro using CCK-8 analysis, MTT assays, and flow cytometry. Our results indicated that 27 targeted metabolites were up-regulated and eight targeted metabolites were down-regulated in the AML group. These metabolites were primarily enriched in pathways related to the biosynthesis of cofactors, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glucagon signaling, 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and central carbon metabolism in cancer. Notably, significant changes were observed in malic acid, alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, and glucuronic acid. In vitro experiments demonstrated that exogenous glucuronic acid can promote the growth and drug resistance of human AML cells.

This study investigated alterations in the seminal plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of infertile male VC patients. Twenty infertile males with VC and twenty-three age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Beijing, China) between October 2019 and April 2021. Untargeted metabolite and lipid profiles from seminal plasma were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Four hundred and seventy-six metabolites and seventeen lipids were significantly different in infertile male VC patients compared to HCs. The top enriched pathways among these significantly different metabolites are protein digestion and absorption, aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of amino acids. Different key lipid species, including triglyceride (TG), diacylglycerol (DG), ceramides (Cer), and phosphatidylserine (PS), varied between VC and HC groups. The distinct metabolites and lipids were moderately correlated. DL-3-phenyllactic acid is a potential diagnostic biomarker for VC-related male infertility (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.893), positively correlating with sperm count, concentration, and motility. Furthermore, DL-3-phenyllactic acid is the only metabolite shared by all four comparisons (VC vs HC, VC-induced oligoasthenospermia [OAS] vs VC-induced asthenospermia [AS], OAS vs HC, and AS vs HC). DL-3-phenyllactic acid significantly decreased in OAS than AS. Metabolite-targeting gene analysis revealed carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) might be the strongest candidate associated with the onset and severity of VC.

The time points-based sample collection is essential to measure the response of individuals to pathophysiological processes and therapeutic interventions. Analytical techniques such as NMR, LC-MS, and GC-MS have been employed to assess a huge number of metabolites present in biological systems. NMR has an advantage over other analytical techniques as it provides a snapshot of tissue and biological fluids, however, it requires higher magnetic fields to achieve better resolution. GC-MS could cover a wide range of metabolites due to high resolution but requires derivatization for certain metabolites. LC-MS is equally competitive and separates a wide range of metabolites with diverse polarities but requires extensive method development.

This is also critical for correlating their biological functions with spatial distribution patterns. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is effectively used to obtain molecular structural information and has been integrated into MSI for spatial mapping of structurally distinct biomolecules, though typically with low coverage. The main technical challenge in achieving high-coverage, high-structure-resolving spatial mapping of biomolecules lies in the limited amount of sample available from each tissue pixel in conventional MS/MS analysis, which restricts the number of MS/MS scans that can be conducted on the metabolite precursors of interest.

The SM d41:2 and SM d36:3 lipids were specifically associated with an increased risk of low-onset cancer and elevated levels of the PC 40:4 lipid. <i>Conclusions</i>: This study demonstrates that untargeted lipidomics, in conjunction with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and machine learning, may effectively identify biomarkers for the early detection of liver cancer. The results suggest that alterations in lipid metabolism are crucial to the progression of liver cancer and provide valuable insights for incorporating lipidomics into precision oncology.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

This study aimed to explore the mechanism of action of <i>Ipomoea pes-caprae</i> water extract (IPE) in the treatment of RA through serum metabolomics and network pharmacology. Rat models of RA with wind-dampness cold bi-syndrome (WCM) and wind-dampness heat bi-syndrome (WHM) were established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of IPE against RA. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) technology was used to analyze the absorbed components of IPE in the plasma of the two models. Serum metabolomics was employed to identify potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways of IPE in the treatment of RA. The key targets and related pathways of RA were screened using network pharmacology and validated using molecular docking. The biomarker-pathway-target network was mapped via the combination of metabolomics and network pharmacology. A total of 10 chemical constituents were identified from WHM rat plasma, and eight chemical constituents were identified from WCM rat plasma. Serum metabolomics research identified 20 endogenous potential biomarkers, and 10 major metabolic pathways closely related to WHM and WCM. Network pharmacology analysis yielded 65 overlapping targets, with the core targets being ALB, AKT1, EGFR, and CASP3. Molecular docking showed that the four absorbed components in plasma had a strong binding activity with ALB and AKT1. Combining metabolomics and network pharmacology, two major biomarkers and two major pathways were identified. IPE can effectively relieve the symptoms of RA, and the potential mechanism of IPE in treating RA has been preliminarily elucidated.

The results showed that compared with the LADG group, the abundance of Firmicutes increased in the HADG group, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria decreased. Metabolomics and transcriptomic analysis revealed that KEGG pathways associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) were enriched in bile acid metabolism. Spearman correlation analysis showed that <i>Oscillospira</i> was positively correlated with <i>ZBTB20</i> and negatively correlated with <i>RADIL</i>. <i>ZBTB20</i> was negatively correlated with <i>dgA-11_gut_group</i>. This study analyzed the regulatory mechanism of average daily gain of beef cattle from genetic, metabolic, and microbial levels, providing a theoretical basis for analyzing the mechanism of differential daily gain of beef cattle, and has important significance for improving the production performance of beef cattle. The multi-omics network provides biomarker foundations for machine learning-based ADG prediction models, offering potential applications in precision breeding. While these biomarkers show promise for precision breeding, their causal roles require further validation. The conclusions are derived from a single breed (Angus) and gender (castrated males). Future studies should include females and diverse breeds to assess generalizability.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

This study aims to identify promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Peripheral venous blood samples from 70 newly diagnosed systemic AL amyloidosis patients, 48 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) patients, and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct metabolic differences between the AL group and the controls (HCs and MM). Machine learning further identified that phytosphingosine and asymmetric dimethylarginine were significantly up-regulated in the AL group compared with HCs group, with area under curve (AUC) values of 0.990 and 0.904, sensitivity and specificity of (97%, 100%) and (88%, 93%), respectively. Compared with MM group, phytosphingosine was also significantly up-regulated in the AL group, with an AUC value of 0.779, sensitivity and specificity of (62%, 88%). Pathway analysis showed significant changes in starch and sucrose metabolism pathway, as well as pentose and glucuronate interconversions pathway between the AL and the controls. Metabolomics combined with machine learning identified phytosphingosine as a promising biomarker for early diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Two metabolic pathways (starch and sucrose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions) may reflect the key pathological processes involved in the development and progression of AL amyloidosis.

To explore which biological systems may contribute to this variation, we examined how individual metabolites and three metabolic scores relate to COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The metabolome of 346 patients was measured using the 1H-NMR Nightingale platform. The association of individual metabolomic features and multi-biomarker scores, i.e. MetaboHealth, MetaboAge, and Infectious Disease Score (IDS) (higher scores reflect poorer health), with in-hospital disease course, long-term recovery, and overall survival were analyzed. Higher values for the metabolites phenylalanine (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.33, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.14-1.56), glucose (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.37, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.16-1.62) and lactate (HR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.38, CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.16-1.63) were associated with mortality.

This study introduces innovative methods to analyze metabolic adaptations in professional football players using a unique UPLC-TOF-MS dataset comprising 93 urinary samples collected over a 10-month football season. Urinary metabolomic profiles were linked to training load data obtained through an electronic performance tracking system. Three approaches combining multivariate analysis with pathway-level insights were developed. PLS regression p-values integrated with functional metabolic analysis identified training load-associated pathways overlooked by univariate methods. Cluster cross-validation enhanced these insights by assessing the contribution of each pathway to the predictive performance, ranking pathways driving the PLS model. Backward feature elimination refined metabolic features most strongly linked to training load, improving the practicality of findings for targeted biomarker validation. Univariate analyses highlighted alterations in Phenylalanine and Histidine metabolisms related to total external load. Multivariate methods identified additional pathways, including Tryptophan, Purine, and Tyrosine metabolisms, as top contributors to the association between metabolic profiles and training load.

Unfortunately, in clinical practice, some patients who received sacubitril/valsartan treatment not only did not show a good therapeutic effect, but also got worse with the passage of time. To explore potential biomarkers for predicting the clinical efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan, serum samples were prospectively collected upon admission and again collected after sacubitril/valsartan treatment was completed. Patients were divided into good response group (GR) and poor response group (PR). At the same time, samples before treatment were divided into GR group and PR group by sample tracing and matching, and metabolomics analysis was conducted. In the end, a total of 9 different metabolites were identified between patients in the early GR and PR groups. In order to find more effective biomarkers, two algorithms, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were used for metabolite selection and performance evaluation, and three kinds of Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) metabolites showed good predictive effect, and the expression of the enzyme phospholipase A2 group IVA (PLA2G4A), associated with this metabolite was significantly elevated in the PR group.

In addition, misdiagnosis with other neuro disorders, such as Alzheimer's (AD), can occur. Herein, an untargeted lipidomic analysis of 75 plasma samples was performed to identify lipid species capable of discriminating between these two neuro groups. Therefore, PLS-DA and OPLS-DA analysis revealed significant differences in patient profiles in the sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid categories. As a result, a putative lipid biomarker panel was developed, which included HexCer (40:1; O2) and PC (O-32:0), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) &gt; 80, respectively. This panel was effective in discriminating between diseased and healthy subjects, but most importantly, it could discriminate between two neurodegenerative disorders that can present similar symptoms, namely PD and AD. Together, these findings suggest that the dysregulated metabolism of lipids plays a critical role in AD and PD pathology and may represent a valuable clinical tool for their diagnosis. Thus, further targeted studies are encouraged to better understand the underlying mechanisms of PD and confirm the diagnostic potency of the identified lipid metabolites.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

This study aims to explore the feasibility of screening novel diagnostic biomarkers based on salivary metabolomics for the limited availability of PFTs and difficulties in implementation at primary care facilities. Participants were recruited from the outpatient department of West China Hospital. Saliva samples were collected to analyze the metabolites through the UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS platform. The raw data from the mass spectrometer was preprocessed with R software after peak extraction. The Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fold change analysis, PCA and orthogonal partial least squares - discriminant analysis were used to identify potential biomarkers. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic efficacy of the predictive model generated by potential biomarkers. Saliva samples were collected from 66 patients with COPD and 55 healthy volunteers. Significant differences in the salivary metabolome between COPD patients and healthy controls were identified, with 261 differential metabolites recognized, 16 of which were considered as potential biomarker. The diagnostic model generated by these 16 biomarkers can successfully distinguish COPD patients from healthy people.

In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-&#x3b1; production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients.

However, no reports have been published on the biomarkers that reflect the intake of WG wheat in the Chinese diet. In an acute, randomized, crossover intervention study performed on 22 Chinese subjects, WG wheat BFI candidates were screened using an LC-HRMS untargeted metabolomics technique. Screening results indicate that alkylresorcinol (AR) metabolites are WG wheat-specific metabolites. These metabolites were systematically characterized by in vitro metabolism reaction, and the matched high-throughput LC-MS/MS-targeted quantitative method was developed. Time-response plots generated via targeted analysis revealed AR oxidation products (AR-OOH) and their sulfate conjugates (AR-OOH-sul) increased rapidly following the WG wheat consumption, which were identified as novel and short-term WG wheat BFIs. Another attractive biomarker was glucuronidated ARs (AR-glu), which can distinguish between WG and refined grain (RG) groups 24&#xa0;h after WG wheat ingestion and is considered a promising medium- and long-term biomarker. Subsequently an independent dose-response study was performed for 38 volunteers who consumed different WG wheat amounts (0, 25, 50 or 100&#xa0;g) for further validation. Identified BFIs perform well in classifying participants into WG wheat consumers or non-consumers, and could capture dose-dependent changes with WG intake increased. Overall, this is the first study to discover and validate WG BFIs in the Chinese population via dietary intervention trials, indicating the potential usefulness for WG wheat intake assessments and dietary compliance monitoring.

Abalones were subjected to varying Cd concentrations for one and two months. While one-month exposure yielded no significant mortality, prolonged exposure to high Cd concentrations for two months substantially elevated mortality risk (hazard ratio = 3.359). Integrated biomarker response values exhibited progressive elevation with both concentration and exposure duration, indicating cumulative perturbation of antioxidant defense and metabolic enzyme systems. Metabolomic analysis revealed distinct temporal and concentration-dependent responses. After one month of exposure, medium concentrations predominantly affected energy and amino acid metabolism with a shift toward anaerobic pathways, while high concentrations activated additional detoxification and stress response mechanisms; after two months of exposure, divergent metabolic strategies emerged, where low concentrations induced lipid remodeling, medium concentrations maintained basic metabolic adjustments, while high concentrations precipitated comprehensive cellular dysfunction. Notably, the observed metabolic focusing at two months represented a forced trade-off under allostatic overload rather than successful adaptation, particularly in high-concentration groups. Combined analysis demonstrated fundamental reorganization of cellular metabolism under prolonged exposure.

Transcriptomic studies identified SNW1 as the most sensitive and specific biomarker, significantly up-regulated in GDM (fold change&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.09; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Metabolomic studies indicated significantly elevated gluconeogenesis in GDM, evidenced by decreased levels of alanine and increased levels of pyruvate and glucose compared to controls. siRNA-mediated knockdown of SNW1 in PANC1 cells resulted in significant down-regulation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT/GPT) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), while glucose transporters (GLUT2/GLUT4) and insulin (INS) were significantly up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. This study identified SNW1 as a novel insulin-resistant gene that induces hyperglycemia by elevating gluconeogenesis and decreasing glucose uptake. SNW1 may be considered a potential therapeutic target with clinical utility for the management of GDM.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Since 2017, SMA patients can be treated with the anti-sense oligonucleotide Nusinersen, which promotes alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, by regular intrathecal injections. In this prospective study, we applied metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analysis to examine sequential CSF samples from 13 SMA patients and controls. This multi-omic approach identified over 800 proteins and 400 small molecules including lipids. Multivariate analysis of multi-omic data successfully discriminated between the CSF derived from SMA patients and control subjects. Lipidomic analysis revealed increased levels of cholesteryl esters and lyso-phospholipids, along with reduced levels of cholesterol and phospholipids in the CSF of SMA patients as compared to healthy controls. These data, combined with results from functional assays, led us to conclude that SMA patients exhibit altered levels and function of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles in the CSF. Notably, Nusinersen therapy was observed to reverse disease-specific profile changes toward a physiological state, potentially explicable by restoring HDL function.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Carcinoma cells that acquire resistance to therapeutic drugs can reprogram their own metabolic processes as a way to overcome the effectiveness of treatment and continue their reproduction processes. Despite the recent developments in medical research in the field of drug resistance, which showed some explanations for this phenomenon, the real explanation, along with the ability to precisely predict the possibility of its occurrence in breast cancer cells, still necessitates a deep consideration of the dynamics of the tumor's response to treatment. For this purpose the current study, combined both <i>in vitro</i> metabolomics and <i>in vivo</i> genomics analysis as the most advanced omics technologies that can provide a potential en route for inventing novel strategies to perform prospective, prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for drug resistance phenomena in mammary cancer. Doxorubicin is the currently available breast cancer chemotherapeutic medication nevertheless; it was demonstrated to cause drug resistance, which impairs patient survival and prognosis by prompting proliferation, cell cycle progression, and preventing apoptosis, interactions between signaling pathways triggered drug resistance. In this research, <i>in vitro</i> metabolomics analysis based on GC-MS coupled with multivariable analysis was performed on MCF-7 and DOX resistant cell lines; MCF-7/adr cultured cells in addition to, further <i>in vivo</i> confirmation via inducing mammary cancer in rats via two doses of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) (50&#x202f;mg/kg and 25&#x202f;mg/kg) proceeded by doxorubicin (5&#x202f;mg/kg) treatment for one month.

FOCs are marked by a dominant follicle that fails to ovulate, disrupting the estrous cycle and reproductive efficiency.

However, the metabolic profile of FF in cystic ovaries needs further exploration. This study examined oxidative stress and metabolic changes in FOC pathogenesis. Using untargeted metabolomics of goat FF, we found significant differences in 12,741 metabolites between cystic and control FF. Cystic FF had reduced levels of &#x3b1;-tocopherol and 8'-apocaroten-8'-ol, key for oxidative stress management, and increased levels of mycotoxins (e.g., Deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside) and long-chain fatty acids.

Metabolomics is the study of the array of low-weight metabolites in a given sample. This emerging field of omics-based science has proved to be effective at furthering the understanding of endometriosis. In this systematic review, we seek to provide an overview of the application of metabolomics in endometriosis. We highlight the use of metabolomics in locating biomarkers for identification, understanding treatment mechanisms and symptoms, and relating external factors to endometriosis. The literature search took place in the Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar based on the keywords \"metabolomics\" AND \"endometriosis\" or \"metabolome\" AND \"endometriosis\". We found 58 articles from 2012 to 2024 that met our search criteria. Significant alterations of lipids, amino acids, as well as other compounds were present in human and animal models. Discrepancies among studies of significantly altered metabolites make it difficult to make general conclusions on the metabolic signature of endometriosis. However, several individual metabolites were elevated in multiple studies of women with endometriosis; these include 3-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, phosphatidic acids, succinate, pyruvate, tetradecenoylcarnitine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. Accordingly, L-isoleucine and citrate were reduced in multiple studies of women with endometriosis.

Metabolomics, especially nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR), offers insights into metabolic profiles' role in diseases, but more research is needed on its connection to CKD and lifestyle factors. Therefore, we utilized the latest metabolomics data from the UK Biobank to explore the relationship between plasma metabolites and lifestyle factors, as well as to investigate the associations between various factors, including lifestyle-related metabolites, and the latent phase of CKD onset. The study enrolled approximately 500,000 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB) between 2006 and 2010, excluding 447,163 individuals with missing data for any metabolite in the NMR metabolomics, any biomarker in the blood chemistry (including eGFR, albumin, or cystatin C), any factor required for constructing the lifestyle score, or a baseline diagnosis of CKD. Lifestyle scores (LS) were calculated based on several factors, including diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, physical activity, and sleep. Each healthy lifestyle component contributed to the overall score, which ranged from 0 to 6. A total of 249 biological metabolites covering multiple categories were determined by the NMR Metabolomics Platform. Random forest algorithms and LASSO regression were employed to identify lifestyle-related metabolites. Subsequently, accelerated failure time models(AFT) were used to assess the relationship between multiple factors, including traditional CKD-related biomarkers (such as eGFR, cystatin C, and albumin) and lifestyle-related metabolites, with the latent phase of incident CKD. Finally, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis on the significant variables identified in the AFT model. Over a mean follow-up period of 13.86 years, 2,279 incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases were diagnosed. Among the 249 metabolites analyzed, 15 were identified as lifestyle-related, primarily lipid metabolites.

Notably, &#x3b1;-phylogenetic diversity was significantly decreased in RRMS patients during the chronic phase (CMS) compared with those in the acute phase (AMS). A distinctive combination of two elevated genera (Slackia, Lactobacillus) and five glycerophospholipid metabolism-associated metabolites (four increased: GPCho(22:5/20:3), PC(18:2(9Z,12Z)/16:0), PE(16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), PE(18:1(11Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)); one decreased: PS(15:0/22:1(13Z))) in RRMS patients when comparing to HCs. Moreover, a biomarker panel consisting of four microbial genera (three decreased: Lysinibacillus, Parabacteroides, UBA1819; one increased: Lachnoanaerobaculum) and two glycerophospholipid metabolism-associated metabolites (one increased: PE(P-16:0/22:6); one decreased: CL(i-12:0/i-16:0/i-17:0/i-12:0)) effectively discriminated CMS patients from AMS patients, which indicate correlation with higher disability. Additionally, DMTs appeared to attenuate MS progression by reducing UBA1819 and upregulating CL(i-12:0/i-16:0/i-17:0/i-12:0). These findings expand our understanding of the microbiome and metabolome roles in RRMS and may contribute to identifying novel diagnostic biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Therefore, early diagnosis of victims of LRI is crucial for improving medical care efficiency. This preclinical study aims to identify circulating metabolites as biomarkers associated with LRI using a C57BL/6J mouse model of hind limb irradiation. More precisely, two independent mice cohorts were used to conduct a broad-spectrum profiling study followed by a suspect screening analysis performed on plasma metabolites by mass spectrometry. An integrative analysis was conducted through a multi-block sparse partial least square discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) to establish multi-scale correlations between specific metabolites levels and biological, physiological (injury severity), and functional parameters (skin perfusion). The identified biomarker signature consists in a 6-metabolite panel including putrescine, uracil, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, L-alanine and pyroglutamate, that can discriminate mice according to radiation dose and injury severity. Our results demonstrate relevant molecular signature associated with LRI in mice and support the use of plasma metabolites as suitable molecular biomarkers for LRI prognosis and diagnosis.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Current control strategies for this condition are limited in efficacy, necessitating further research into the underlying mechanisms. Although metabolomics has been applied to study various diseases, its use in understanding postmenopausal hypertension is scarce. Therefore, an ovariectomized rat model was used to simulate postmenopausal conditions. Estrogen levels, blood pressure, and aortic tissue metabolomics were analyzed. Animal models were divided into Sham, OVX, and OVX +E groups. Serum estrogen levels, blood pressure measurements, and aortic tissue metabolomics analyses were performed using radioimmunoassay, UHPLC-Q-TOF, and bioinformatics techniques. Based on the above research content, we successfully established a correlation between low estrogen levels and postmenopausal hypertension in rats. Notable differences in blood pressure parameters and aortic tissue metabolites were observed across the experimental groups. Specifically, metabolites that were differentially expressed, particularly L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (L-AABA), showed potential as a biomarker for postmenopausal hypertension, potentially exerting a protective function through macrophage activation and vascular remodeling. Enrichment analysis revealed alterations in sugar metabolism pathways, such as the Warburg effect and glycolysis, indicating their involvement in postmenopausal hypertension. Overall, this current research provides insights into the metabolic changes associated with postmenopausal hypertension, highlighting the role of L-AABA and sugar metabolism reprogramming in aortic tissue. The findings suggest a potential link between low estrogen levels, macrophage function, and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal hypertension. Further investigations are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications for postmenopausal women.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Current approaches require time-consuming bacterial isolation and enrichment procedures, delaying stratified treatment. Here, we describe a biomarker-based strategy that utilises bacterial small molecular metabolites and lipids for direct detection of bacteria in complex samples using mass spectrometry (MS). A spectral metabolic library of 233 bacterial species is mined for markers showing specificity at different phylogenetic levels. Using a univariate statistical analysis method, we determine 359 so-called taxon-specific markers (TSMs). We apply these TSMs to the in situ detection of bacteria using healthy and cancerous gastrointestinal tissues as well as faecal samples. To demonstrate the MS method-agnostic nature, samples are analysed using spatial metabolomics and traditional bulk-based metabolomics approaches. In this work, TSMs are found in &gt;90% of samples, suggesting the general applicability of this workflow to detect bacterial presence with standard MS-based analytical methods.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Although there are various methods to treat lung cancer at present, but lung cancer is asymptomatic in the early stages and has a high recurrence rate after late treatment which make it difficult to cure with conventional treatments. Drug combinations for the treatment of lung cancer have been used in many clinical studies. In this study, we constructed a recurrence model of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) lung cancer and used a combination of Ginsenoside H dripping pills (GH) and vinorelbine (NVB) to treat the recurrence of lung cancer. The results showed that the inhibition rate of the combined treatment of GH and NVB is 74.81% which is significantly higher than the therapeutic effect of separate use. We also used GC-TOF/MS-based metabolomics to identify differentially abundant metabolites in relapse models and explore biomarker trends. We found that there are 12 metabolite differences in the abundance of metabolites between the treatment groups (GH group, NVB group and GH-NVB group) and the model group, such as glucose 6-phosphate, palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, guanine, allantoic acid. The differences in these metabolites involve glucose and lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and purine metabolism. We further analyzed the changes in the content of these metabolites and found that the combined use of GH and NVB can regulate purine metabolism, folate synthesis, and thiamine metabolism, ultimately reducing the abnormal increase in alkaline phosphatase (AP). This study provides a method for the treatment of lung cancer and some biomarkers for the detection of lung cancer.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in serum metabolites between patients with heart failure (HF) and healthy control (HC) and to diagnose HF qualitatively. In this study, serum samples from 83 patients with HF and 35 HCs were used as the research subjects for untargeted metabolomic analysis using ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) technology. Potential biomarkers were screened and validated using the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), random forest (RF), binary logistic regression (BLR), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results indicated that a total of 43 metabolites were considered as differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs). Among these DEMs, glycodeoxycholate was identified as a specific biomarker of HF. A ROC curve analysis for HC versus HF discrimination showed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9853 (95% CI: 0.9859-1.0000), a sensitivity of 95%, and a specificity of 100%. Hence, glycodeoxycholate might serve as a potential biomarker for HF. Furthermore, the amino acid metabolism was screened as the most significantly altered pathway in patients with HF.

Metabolomics offers promising new approaches for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of PCa. However, metabolomics data are characterized by high dimensionality, noise, variability, and small sample sizes, presenting substantial challenges for classification. Despite the wide range of applications of deep learning methods, the use of deep learning in metabolomics research has not been extensively explored. In this study, we propose a hybrid model, TransConvNet, which combines transformer and convolutional neural networks for the classification of prostate cancer metabolomics data. We introduce a 1D convolution layer for the inputs to the dot-product attention mechanism, enabling the interaction of both local and global information. Additionally, a gating mechanism is incorporated to dynamically adjust the attention weights. The features extracted by multi-head attention are further refined through 1D convolution, and a residual network is introduced to alleviate the gradient vanishing problem in the convolutional layers. We conducted comparative experiments with seven other machine learning algorithms. Through five-fold cross-validation, TransConvNet achieved an accuracy of 81.03% and an AUC of 0.89, significantly outperforming the other algorithms. Additionally, we validated TransConvNet's generalization ability through experiments on the lung cancer dataset, with the results demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to different metabolomics datasets. We also proposed the MI-RF (Mutual Information-based random forest) model, which effectively identified key biomarkers associated with prostate cancer by leveraging comprehensive feature weight coefficients. In contrast, traditional methods identified only a limited number of biomarkers. In summary, these results highlight the potential of TransConvNet and MI-RF in both classification tasks and biomarker discovery, providing valuable insights for the clinical application of prostate cancer diagnosis.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

It leads to hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which in turn increases the formation of glucocorticoids (GCs). Chronically elevated GC levels disrupt neuroplasticity and affect brain lipid metabolism, which may, ultimately, contribute to the development of depression. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the antidepressants St. John's Wort extract and escitalopram on lipid metabolism in vivo. Therefore, repeated corticosterone injections were used to induce depression-like behavior in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were stressed with corticosterone injections (40 mg/kg, s.c.) over 22 consecutive days and were concomitantly treated with varying doses of the St. John's wort extract Ze 117 (30, 90 or 180 mg/kg, p.o.) or escitalopram (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and behavioral changes were evaluated using a modified forced swim test. The results indicate that repeated corticosterone injections significantly decreased the latency to first immobility. Furthermore, co-treatment of corticosterone with Ze 117 increased latency to first immobility significantly compared to rats treated with corticosterone alone. To further investigate the biochemical effects of corticosterone-induced stress, as well as the possible counter-regulation by antidepressants, the lipidomes of the plasma and hippocampus samples were analyzed by shotgun mass spectrometry. Corticosterone-induced stress significantly altered key lipid metabolites in the plasma but not in the hippocampal samples. In the hippocampus, however, specific glycerophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) increased with escitalopram treatment and with Ze 117, both showing significant correlations with behavioral parameters. In summary, our study shows significant behavioral- and lipidome-altering processes with Ze 117 and escitalopram in rat plasma and hippocampal samples, thereby providing new targets and biomarker ideas for clinical diagnosis and antidepressant intervention.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Biomarker-driven approaches have emerged as a promising strategy to optimize DS prescriptions, ensuring precision and reducing risks associated with generic recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> This narrative review synthesizes findings from key studies on biomarker-guided dietary supplementation and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomarker analysis. Key biomarker categories-genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, microbiome, and immunological-were reviewed, alongside AI applications for interpreting these biomarkers and tailoring supplement prescriptions. <b>Results:</b> Biomarkers enable the identification of deficiencies, metabolic imbalances, and disease predispositions, supporting targeted and safe DS use. For example, genomic markers like MTHFR polymorphisms inform folate supplementation needs, while metabolomic markers such as glucose and insulin levels guide interventions in metabolic disorders. AI-driven tools streamline biomarker interpretation, optimize supplement selection, and enhance therapeutic outcomes by accounting for complex biomarker interactions and individual needs. <b>Limitations:</b> Despite these advancements, AI tools face significant challenges, including reliance on incomplete training datasets and a limited number of clinically validated algorithms.

We analyzed 42,663 RNA transcripts in 1453 MZ twins and 1294 DZ twins from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), followed by sex-stratified analyses. The top 5% transcripts with lowest p-values were analyzed for replication in 217 MZ and 158 DZ twins from the older Finnish Twin cohort (FTC). In the NTR, one transcript (PURG) was significantly differentially expressed between MZ and DZ twins; but this did not replicate in FTC. Pathway analyses highlighted the WNT-pathway, previously associated with MZ twinning, and the TGF-B and SMAD pathway, previously associated with DZ twinning. Meta-analysis of 169 serum metabolites in 2797 MZ and 2040 DZ twins from the NTR, FTC and FinnTwin12, showed no metabolomic differences. Overall, we did not find replicable transcript-level expression differences in blood between MZ and DZ twins, but highlighted the TGF-B/SMAD pathway as a potential transcriptional biomarker for DZ twinning.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Tear fluid, which contains essential components vital for maintaining ocular surface health, has been investigated for its potential in the noninvasive identification of ocular biomarkers through metabolomics analysis. In this study, we employed UHPLC-MS/MS to analyze the tear metabolome of CD patients. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of tear samples from CD patients revealed significant metabolic alterations. Compared with the control group, 298 metabolites were elevated, while 142 were decreased. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that these changes primarily affected arginine and proline metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and phenylalanine biosynthesis in CD. Notably, 3-dehydroquinic acid, anthranilic acid, citric acid, and l-isoleucine emerged as potential biomarker candidates of CD with high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.94). These findings suggest that tear fluid metabolism, particularly amino acid biosynthesis, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CD. Uncovering these metabolic products and pathways provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying CD and paves the way for the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

However, matrix effect (ME), which may lead to altered ionization efficiency due to co-eluting compounds, is a significant challenge during biological analysis. Therefore, ME evaluation plays a crucial role during method development. Two approaches to evaluate ME are using stable isotope labelled-internal standards (SIL-IS) and post-column infusion (PCI) of standards. In this study, we developed an untargeted HILIC-MS method by applying four PCI standards for ME evaluation. We found PCI is a compelling approach for ME assessment compared to SIL-IS method due to its advantage in untargeted analysis. Through the ME evaluation and chromatographic performance comparison of 18 SIL standards across three columns and three different mobile phase pH conditions, our findings revealed that the BEH-Z-HILIC column operated at pH 4 with 10 mM ammonium formate exhibited minimal ME and superior performance. The method showed exceptional linearity (R&#xb2; &gt; 0.98), reliable repeatability (RSD &lt; 15 %), good inter-day precision (RSD &lt; 30 %), and acceptable recovery (&gt;75 %) for all SIL standards. Absolute matrix effect (AME) and relative matrix effect (RME) assessment in three plasma donors revealed a high consistency between PCI and SIL-IS approaches. Finally, this method coupled with the PCI approach was applied to 40 plasma samples. Fifty endogenous compounds were detected and their AME and RME were evaluated. Results showed that many compounds experienced severe ion suppression, though their ME variation between 40 samples is low. In conclusion, PCI method is a robust alternative for monitoring ME and evaluating ME of endogenous compounds during untargeted method optimization and biological analysis.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

We used 2&#x2005;382 Doetinchem Cohort Study participants' (aged 46.0-85.4) cross-sectional data, of whom 1&#x2005;654 had longitudinal SAF measurements. SAF was measured using the AGE Reader.

Linear regressions were used for the associations of SAF and MetaboHealth on the 36-deficit frailty index and logistic regressions for being pre-frail or frail as determined by the frailty phenotype. Longitudinal associations were determined by an interaction term between age and SAF in a linear mixed model. SAF and MetaboHealth were associated with higher odds of pre-frailty (odd ratios per standard deviation SAF: 1.21 [1.10-1.32], MetaboHealth: 1.35 [1.24-1.49]) and frailty (SAF: 1.70 [1.41-2.06], MetaboHealth: 1.90 [1.57-2.32]).

This research aimed to delineate both the proteomic and metabolomic landscapes inherent to exosomes, assessing their diagnostic utility in postoperative delirium (POD) and understanding the underlying pathophysiological frameworks. Integrated analyses of proteomics and metabolomics were conducted on exosomes derived from plasma of individuals from both the non-postoperative delirium (NPOD) control group and the POD group. Subsequently, the study utilized the Connectivity Map (CMap) methodology for the identification of promising small-molecule drugs and carried out molecular docking assessments to explore the binding affinities with the enzyme MMP9 of these identified molecules. We identified significant differences in exosomal metabolites and proteins between the POD and control groups, highlighting pathways related to neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Our CMap analysis identified potential small-molecule therapeutics, and molecular docking studies revealed two compounds with high affinity to MMP9, suggesting a new therapeutic avenue for POD.

Despite that, there are still gaps in using non-conventional biomatrices in metabolomics research. In this sense, this study aimed to elucidate the main analytical factors involved in the extraction and analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in cerumen by headspace/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS/GC-MS) using Design of Experiments (DoE) approaches. Furthermore, we present a repeatability study for the proposed method as a quality control process for cerumenomic assays. By applying factorial designs, it was possible to determine that the sample mass, splitless injector sampling time, headspace extraction time, headspace extraction temperature, injection volume, and vial volume were significant factors for the cerumen VOC analysis by HS/GC-MS. Throughout univariate and multivariate statistical approaches, we demonstrate that different analytical conditions lead to distinct chemical profiling of a sample. The most suitable analytical condition was determined after the optimization steps, and the proposed method's repeatability was evaluated by the metabolites coefficient variation (CV) calculation. Seventy-one earwax VOCs reached a CV considered adequate for untargeted metabolomics studies via GC-MS. In summary, this study describes a protocol for analysis optimization of a non-conventional biomatrix and also reports a quality control process in untargeted volatilomics assays using earwax.

Infection prognosis takes on particular importance when allocating scarce antiviral antibodies and drugs, which are most effective when administered before the onset of severe disease. During arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic to the United States in 2020, we conducted a prognostic biomarker discovery and validation effort based upon metabolomic profiling with a liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) type used clinically for rapid toxicology. We obtained urine specimens from 163 patients presenting for evaluation. We obtained LC-MS profiles in the initial cohort and used machine learning methods to define a simplified urine metabolomic signature associated with respiratory failure or death by 90 days. This signature was composed of three metabotypes linked to intestinal microbiome metabolism and anticonvulsant use, with a receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 89.4%. Blinded application of this signature to the subsequent validation cohort yielded a ROC AUC of 81.2%. A model trained on the two baseline metabotypes present before intubation exhibited similar performance in the validation cohort. This study demonstrates the plausibility and promise of rapid metabolome-based prognostic discovery and validation in the opening wave of a pandemic. The approach used here could be used to inform therapeutic and resource allocation decisions early in a future epidemic.IMPORTANCEIn a new respiratory virus pandemic, the ability to identify patients at greatest risk for severe disease is essential to direct scarce medical resources to those most likely to benefit from them. Tools to predict disease severity are best developed early in a pandemic, but laboratory-based resources to develop these may be limited by available technology and by infection precautions. Here, we show that an accessible metabolic profiling approach could identify a prognostic signature of severe disease in the initial wave of COVID-19, when patients presenting for care often exceeded the available doses of convalescent plasma and remdesivir. In a future pandemic, this approach, alongside efforts to identify clinical disease severity predictors, could improve patient outcomes and facilitate therapeutic trials by identifying individuals at high risk for severe disease.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

Diagnosis of AD largely depends on the clinical symptoms of AD. Currently, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques are considered for clinical detection and diagnosis. However, these clinical diagnosis results could provide indications of the middle and/or late stages of AD rather than the early stage, and another limitation is the complexity attached to limited access, cost, and perceived invasiveness. Therefore, the prediction of AD still poses immense challenges, and the development of novel biomarkers is needed for early diagnosis and urgent intervention before the onset of obvious phenotypes of AD. Blood-based biomarkers may enable earlier diagnose and aid detection and prognosis for AD because various substances in the blood are vulnerable to AD pathophysiology. The application of a systematic biological paradigm based on high-throughput techniques has demonstrated accurate alterations of molecular levels during AD onset processes, such as protein levels and metabolite levels, which may facilitate the identification of AD at an early stage. Notably, proteomics and metabolomics have been used to identify candidate biomarkers in blood for AD diagnosis. This review summarizes data on potential blood-based biomarkers identified by proteomics and metabolomics that are closest to clinical implementation and discusses the current challenges and the future work of blood-based candidates to achieve the aim of early screening for AD.

However, data analysis workflows are complex and face many challenges. Two of these challenges are the demand of high sample size and the possibility of severe class imbalance, which is particularly common in clinical studies. The latter can make statistical models less generalizable, increase the risk of overfitting and skew the analysis in favour of the majority class. One possible approach to mitigate this problem is data augmentation. However, the use of artificial data requires adequate data augmentation methods and criteria for assessing the quality of the generated data. In this work, we used Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GPs) for data augmentation of metabolomics data. Using a set of benchmark datasets, we applied several criteria for the evaluation of the quality of generated data and assessed the performance of supervised predictive models trained with datasets that included such data. CWGAN-GP models generated realistic data with identical characteristics to real samples, mostly avoiding mode collapse. Furthermore, in cases of class imbalance, the performance of predictive models improved by supplementing the minority class with generated samples. This is evident for high quality datasets with well separated classes. Conversely, model improvements were quite modest for high class overlap datasets. This trend was confirmed by using synthetic datasets with different class separation levels.

Following ovariectomy surgery, menopausal mice were monitored for changes in their biomarker levels, and the integrity of the large artery walls in each treatment group was observed through hematoxylin and eosin staining. <i>In vitro</i> cellular models were utilized to assess variations in lipid metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and changes in the levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzymes in different cell groups postintervention using Western blot analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Treatment with carnitine in postmenopausal mouse models led to increased plasma cholesterol and carnitine levels, as well as indicators of arterial sclerosis. In HepG2 cells, carnitine treatment resulted in heightened lipid levels, elevated ROS production, and decreased antioxidant enzyme levels. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The findings suggest that carnitine may serve as a potential risk marker or therapeutic target for postmenopausal hypercholesterolemia. This study provides valuable insights into cardiovascular conditions in post-MW and offers new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Continued research in this area is crucial to enhance our understanding of cardiovascular diseases in post-MW and to explore additional treatment options.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Metabolomics offers the potential to develop non-invasive screening and diagnostic tools based on metabolic biomarkers. However, the inherent complexity of metabolomic datasets and the high dimensionality of biomarkers complicates the identification of diagnostically relevant features, with multiple studies demonstrating limited consensus on the specific metabolites involved. Unlike previous studies that rely on singular feature selection techniques such as Partial Least Square (PLS) or LASSO regression, this research combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods with random sampling strategies, offering a more robust and interpretable approach to feature selection. This study aimed to identify a parsimonious and robust set of biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis using metabolomics data. Plasma samples from 185 breast cancer patients and 53 controls (from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, USA) were analyzed. This study also overcomes the common issue of dataset imbalance by using propensity score matching (PSM), which ensures reliable comparisons between cancer and control groups. We employed Univariate Na&#xef;ve Bayes, L2-regularized Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and feature engineering techniques to refine and select the most informative features. Our best-performing feature set comprised 11 biomarkers, including 9 metabolites (SM(OH) C22:2, SM C18:0, C0, C3OH, C14:2OH, C16:2OH, LysoPC a C18:1, PC aa C36:0 and Asparagine), a metabolite ratio (Kynurenine-to-Tryptophan), and 1 demographic variable (Age), achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 98%. These results demonstrate the potential for a robust, cost-effective, and non-invasive breast cancer screening and diagnostic tool, offering significant clinical value for early detection and personalized patient management.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Metabolites produced by microbial metabolism can travel through the bloodstream to reach distal organs and affect their function, ultimately influencing the development of relevant production traits such as meat quality. Meat quality is a complex trait made up of a number of characteristics and intramuscular fat content (IMF) is considered to be one of the most important parameters. In this study, 52 rabbits from 2 lines divergently selected for IMF (high-IMF (H) and low-IMF (L) lines) were used to perform an untargeted metabolomic analysis of their cecal content, with the aim to obtain information on genetically determined microbial metabolism related to IMF. A large, correlated response to selection was found in their cecal metabolome composition. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to identify the pathways differentiating the lines, which showed a classification accuracy of 99%. On the other hand, 2 linear partial least squares analyses were performed, one for each line, to extract evidence on the specific pathways associated with IMF deposition within each line, which showed predictive abilities (estimated using the Q2) of approximately 60%. The most relevant pathways differentiating the lines were those related to amino acids (aromatic, branched-chain, and gamma-glutamyl), secondary bile acids, and purines. The higher content of secondary bile acids in the L-line was related to greater lipid absorption, while the differences found in purines suggested different fermentation activities, which could be related to greater nitrogen utilization and energy efficiency in the L-line. The linear analyses showed that lipid metabolism had a greater relative importance for IMF deposition in the L-line, whereas a more complex microbial metabolism was associated with the H-line. The lysophospholipids and gamma-glutamyl amino acids were associated with IMF in both lines; the nucleotide and secondary bile acid metabolisms were mostly associated in the H-line; and the long-chain and branched-chain fatty acids were mostly associated in the L-line. A metabolic signature consisting of 2 secondary bile acids and 2 protein metabolites was found with 88% classification accuracy, pointing to the interaction between lipid absorption and protein metabolism as a relevant driver of the microbiome activity influencing IMF.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Therefore, it is necessary to find innovative strategies for detecting specific biomarkers in order to diagnose infections. The rapid advancement of metabolomics makes it possible to determine the pattern of metabolite changes in the both of pathogen and the host during an infection. Metabolomics is a method used to assess the levels and type of metabolites in an organism.

Over time, correlating clinical findings with genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic results has been challenging due to diverse sampling methods, analysis techniques, and the use of variable clinical phenotype descriptions across studies. This review aims to summarize the results from various omics fields to explore the etiopathology of HS. Genetic studies highlight defects in Notch and &#x3b3;-secretase signaling and inflammasome function. Syndromic HS involves specific mutations in autoinflammatory syndromes such as pyogenic sterile arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) and pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and HS (PASH). Proteomic analyses reveal key inflammatory pathways indicating activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Additionally, microbiome studies show an increased presence of anaerobes like <i>Prevotella</i> in HS lesions and a decreased presence of commensals such as <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, particularly involving <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> and <i>Clostridium ramosum</i>, is associated with HS. Moreover, metabolomic profiling indicates dysregulated tryptophan catabolism and lipid metabolism, with increased 5-lipoxygenase-derived metabolites and odd-chain fatty acids suggesting bacterial involvement. In summary, despite advances, robust associations between genetics, proteomics, microbiome, and metabolomics in HS are still lacking. Integrating these datasets could identify new clinical phenotypes, genetic predispositions, microbial signatures, and therapeutic targets, enhancing personalized treatment strategies and biomarker discovery for HS classification, prognosis, and treatment response.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

To uncover the characteristics of proteomics landscape and potential multi-omics interaction networks in CpwMS, Plasma samples were collected from 22 CpwMS and 22 healthy controls (HCs) and analyzed using a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach. Our results showed that the plasma proteomics pattern was significantly different in CpwMS compared to HCs. A total of 90 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), such as LAMP1 and FCG2A, were identified in CpwMS plasma comparing to HCs. Furthermore, we also observed extensive and significant correlations between the altered proteomic profiles and the changes of metabolome, gut microbiome, as well as altered immunoinflammatory responses in MS-affected patients.

A better understanding of the interactions between heme synthesis and global metabolism would improve the management of AIP patients. An untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed on the urine of 114 patients with overt AIP and asymptomatic carriers using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry.

A total of 239 metabolites were annotated in urine samples by matching chromatographic and mass spectral characteristics with those from our chemical library. Twenty-six metabolites, including porphyrin precursors, intermediates of tryptophan or glycine metabolism and, unexpectedly, bile acids, showed significant concentration differences between the phenotypic groups. Dysregulation of bile acid metabolism was confirmed by targeted quantitative analysis, which revealed an imbalance in favor of hydrophobic bile acids associated with changes in conjugation, which was more pronounced in the severe phenotype.

This study aimed to elucidate the dynamic lipidomic changes occurring during the initial stages of equine pregnancy, with a specific focus on days 7 and 14 post-ovulation. By analysing and comparing the plasma lipid profiles of pregnant and non-pregnant mares, the objective of this study was to identify potential biomarkers for pregnancy and gain insights into the biochemical adaptations essential for supporting maternal recognition of pregnancy and early embryonic development. Employing discovery lipidomics, we analysed plasma samples from pregnant and non-pregnant mares on days 7 and 14 post-conception using the SCIEX ZenoTOF 7600 system. This high-resolution mass spectrometry approach enabled us to comprehensively profile and compare the lipidomes across these critical early gestational timepoints. Our analysis revealed significant lipidomic alterations between pregnant and non-pregnant mares and between days 7 and 14 of pregnancy. Key findings include the upregulation of bile acids, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylinositols, and triglycerides in pregnant mares. These changes suggest enhanced lipid synthesis and mobilization, likely associated with the embryo's nutritional requirements and the establishment of embryo-maternal interactions. There were significant differences in lipid metabolism between pregnant and non-pregnant mares, with a notable increase in the sterol lipid BA 24:1;O5 in pregnant mares as early as day 7 of gestation, suggesting it as a sensitive biomarker for early pregnancy detection. Notably, the transition from day 7 to day 14 in pregnant mares is characterized by a shift towards lipids indicative of membrane biosynthesis, signalling activity, and preparation for implantation.

Omics screening, using easily collectible serum samples, could serve as an initial step. Alongside biomarker identification capabilities, omics analysis allows for a comprehensive analysis of prevalent histological types-DCIS and IDC. Employing metabolomics, metallomics, and machine learning, could yield accurate screening models with valuable insights into organism responses. Serum samples of confirmed breast cancer patients were utilized to analyze metabolite and metal ion profiles, using two distinct analysis methods, proton NMR for metabolomics and ICP-OES for metallomics. The resulting responses were then subjected to discriminant analysis, progression biomarker exploration, examination of correlations between patients' metabolites and metal ions, and the impact of age and menopause status. Measured NMR spectra and metabolite relative integrals were used to achieve statistically significant discrimination through MVA between breast cancer and control groups. The analysis identified 24 metabolites and 4 metal ions crucial for discrimination. Furthermore, four metabolites were associated with disease progression. Additionally, there were important correlations and relationships between metabolite relative integrals, metal ion concentrations, and age/menopausal status subgroups. Quantified relative integrals allowed for discrimination between studied subgroups, validated with a holdout set. Feature importance and statistical analysis for metabolomics and metallomics extracted a set of common entities which in combination provides valuable insights into ongoing molecular disturbances and disease progression.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Evidences demonstrate blood microbiota primarily originates from the gut and may act as a biomarker for breast cancer. We aimed to characterize the microbiota-gut microbial metabolites cross-talk in blood and develop a composite diagnostic panel for breast cancer. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics profiling on blood samples from 107 breast cancer cases and 107 age-paired controls. We found that the alpha diversity of the blood microbiota was decreased in breast cancer compared to controls. There were significantly different profiles of microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood between these two groups, with nine bacterial genera and four gut microbial metabolites increased in patients, while thirty-nine bacterial genera and two gut microbial metabolites increased in controls. Some breast cancer-associated gut microbial metabolites were linked to differential blood microbiota, and a composite microbiota-metabolite diagnostic panel was further developed with an area under the curve of 0.963 for breast cancer. This study underscored the pivotal role of microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood and their interactions for breast carcinogenesis, as well as the potential of a composite diagnostic panel as a non-invasive biomarker for breast cancer.IMPORTANCEOur integrated analysis demonstrated altered profiles of microbiota and gut microbial metabolites in blood for breast cancer patients.

This study investigated how amino acid, glycolysis, and bile acid metabolism affect ICI efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Through targeted metabolomic profiling and machine learning analysis, we identified amino acid metabolism as a key factor, with histidine (His) linked to favorable outcomes and homocysteine (HCys), phenylalanine (Phe), and sarcosine (Sar) linked to poor outcomes. Importantly, the His/HCys+Phe+Sar ratio emerges as a robust biomarker. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of glycolysis-related metabolites, particularly lactate. Elevated lactate levels post-immunotherapy treatment correlate with poorer outcomes, underscoring lactate as a potential indicator of treatment efficacy. Moreover, specific bile acids, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), are associated with better survival and therapeutic response. Particularly, TLCA enhances T cell activation and anti-tumor immunity, suggesting its utility as a predictive biomarker and therapeutic agent. We also suggest a connection between gut microbiota and TLCA levels, with the Eubacterium genus modulating this relationship. Therefore, modulating specific metabolic pathways-particularly amino acid, glycolysis, and bile acid metabolism-could predict and enhance the efficacy of ICI therapy in NSCLC patients, with potential implications for personalized treatment strategies in immuno-oncology.

The immune response in septic shock is tightly regulated by cellular metabolism and transitions from early hyper-inflammation to later hypo-inflammation. Patients are susceptible to secondary infections during hypo-inflammation. The magnitude of the metabolic dysregulation and the effect of plasma metabolites on the circulating immune cells in septic shock are not reported. We hypothesized that the accumulated plasma metabolites affect the immune response in septic shock during hypo-inflammation. Our study took a unique approach. Using peripheral blood from adult septic shock patients and healthy controls, we studied: (i) Whole blood stimulation &#xb1; E. Coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS: endotoxin) to analyze plasma TNF protein, and (ii). Plasma metabolomic profile by Metabolon. Inc. (iii) We exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls to commercially available carbohydrate, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolites and studied the response to LPS. We report that: (i) The whole blood stimulation of the healthy control group showed a significantly upregulated TNF protein, while the septic shock group remained endotoxin tolerant, a biomarker for hypo-inflammation. (ii) A significant accumulation of carbohydrate, amino acid, fatty acid, ceramide, sphingomyelin, and TCA cycle pathway metabolites in septic shock plasma. (iii) In vitro exposure to 5 metabolites repressed while 2 metabolites upregulated the inflammatory response of PBMCs to LPS. We conclude that the endotoxin-tolerant phenotype of septic shock is associated with a simultaneous accumulation of plasma metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways, and these metabolites fundamentally influence the immune response profile of circulating cells.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2025}

The TPOT tool, which is an AutoML tool, was used to optimize the preparation of features and data, as well as to select the most suitable machine learning model. The TreeSHAP approach, which is a type of XAI, was used to interpret the model by assessing each metabolite's individual contribution to the categorization process. <b>Results:</b> TPOT had superior performance in distinguishing between HCC and cirrhosis compared to other AutoML approaches AutoSKlearn and H2O AutoML, in addition to traditional machine learning models such as random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor. The TPOT technique attained an AUC value of 0.81, showcasing superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in comparison to the other models. Key metabolites, including L-valine, glycine, and DL-isoleucine, were identified as essential by TPOT and subsequently verified by TreeSHAP analysis. TreeSHAP provided a comprehensive explanation of the contribution of these metabolites to the model's predictions, thereby increasing the interpretability and dependability of the results. This thorough assessment highlights the strength and reliability of the AutoML framework in the development of clinical biomarkers. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study shows that AutoML and XAI can be used together to create metabolomic biomarkers that are specific to HCC.

The biomarker metabolites in serum associated with growth performance of chickens were identified by comparing the serum metabolome differences between chickens that significantly differed in their weights at 160 days of age when fed identical diets. A total of 766 metabolites were identified including 13 differential metabolite classes such as lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and their derivatives, and organoheterocyclic compounds. The results of difference analysis using a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model indicated that the low-body-weight group could be differentiated based on inflammatory markers including prostaglandin a2, kynurenic acid and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA), and inflammation-related metabolic pathways including tryptophan and arachidonic acid metabolism. In contrast, the sera of high-body-weight chickens were enriched for riboflavin and 2-isopropylmalic acid and for metabolic pathways including riboflavin metabolism, acetyl group transfer into mitochondria, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Unfortunately, many prostate cancer patients develop resistance to docetaxel. Clinical markers less invasive than biopsies, such as blood samples, would be ideal for monitoring and predicting patient treatment outcomes to docetaxel. Lipid alterations are often associated with the progression of many cancers, including prostate cancer. This study investigated the use of lipids from whole blood as clinical markers for docetaxel resistance in a small cohort of patients with prostate cancer. Qualitative lipidomics was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to assess the lipid composition of prostate cancer cells exposed to docetaxel as well as whole blood from prostate cancer patients before, during and after docetaxel treatment. Three patients had castration resistant prostate cancer, three had castration sensitive prostate cancer, and four had de novo prostate cancer during the extent of the study. Mean decrease accuracy and classical univariate receiving operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to identify potential biomarkers. In total, 245 and 221 altered lipids were identified from a second stage of mass spectrometry analysis of prostate cancer cells and clinical blood samples, respectively. Both models indicated that docetaxel treatment altered ether-linked phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholine, diacylglycerols, ceramides, hexosylceramides, and sphingomyelins. The results also indicated several lipid changes were associated with sphingolipid signaling and metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism.

Untargeted metabolomic analyses were conducted on untreated and AZA-treated seedlings at two time points: 7 and 14&#x2009;days after treatment initiation. The results revealed a general accumulation of sugars (e.g., glucose, mannose, xylose), amino acids (e.g., lysine, GABA, threonine, glutamine), and organic acids (e.g., glutaric acid, shikimic acid, succinic acid) in AZA treated-seedlings, suggesting that AZA triggers stress responses in Arabidopsis. Ionomic analysis revealed that AZA induces phosphorus deficiency, which plants compensate by increasing malate content in the roots. Additionally, AZA treatment induced putrescine accumulation within the root, a metabolic biomarker of potassium deficiency and plant stress. The metabolomic profile showed elevated levels of different specialized metabolites, such as nitrogen- and sulphur-containing compounds, and altered levels of various phytohormones, including jasmonates and brassinosteroids, implicated in plant protection under biotic and/or abiotic stresses. These findings support the hypothesis that AZA's mode of action is associated with an auxin imbalance, suggesting its function as an auxinic herbicide. The observed increases in starch and jasmonates, coupled with the disruptions in potassium homeostasis, are linked to the previously reported alterations in the auxin transport, root architecture and gravitropic root response.

Leveraging ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), this study aimed to characterize the lipidomic profile of serum exosomes from SCZ patients, assessing their potential as novel biomarkers for SCZ diagnosis through absolute quantitative lipidomics. Our comprehensive lipidomic analysis unveiled 39 serum exosomal lipids that were differentially expressed between SCZ patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (HC, n = 20). These findings revealed a profound dysregulation in lipid metabolism pathways, notably in sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism. Among these, seven exosomal lipids stood out for their diagnostic potential, exhibiting remarkable ability to differentiate SCZ patients from HCs with an unparalleled classification performance, evidenced by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00). These lipids included specific ceramides and phosphoethanolamines, pointing to a distinct lipid metabolic fingerprint associated with SCZ. Furthermore, bioinformatic analyses reinforced the pivotal involvement of these lipids in SCZ-related lipid metabolic processes, suggesting their integral role in the disorder's pathophysiology. This study significantly advances our understanding of SCZ by pinpointing dysregulated exosomal lipid metabolism as a key factor in its pathology.

Current protocols for metabolome data analysis often struggle with handling large-scale datasets or require programming skills. To address this, we present MetMiner (https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MetMiner), a user-friendly, full-functionality pipeline specifically designed for plant metabolomics data analysis. Built on R shiny, MetMiner can be deployed on servers to utilize additional computational resources for processing large-scale datasets. MetMiner ensures transparency, traceability, and reproducibility throughout the analytical process. Its intuitive interface provides robust data interaction and graphical capabilities, enabling users without prior programming skills to engage deeply in data analysis. Additionally, we constructed and integrated a plant-specific mass spectrometry database into the MetMiner pipeline to optimize metabolite annotation. We have also developed MDAtoolkits, which include a complete set of tools for statistical analysis, metabolite classification, and enrichment analysis, to facilitate the mining of biological meaning from the datasets. Moreover, we propose an iterative weighted gene co-expression network analysis strategy for efficient biomarker metabolite screening in large-scale metabolomics data mining. In two case studies, we validated MetMiner's efficiency in data mining and robustness in metabolite annotation. Together, the MetMiner pipeline represents a promising solution for plant metabolomics analysis, providing a valuable tool for the scientific community to use with ease.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

This study aimed to investigate the metabolic changes during disease occurrence and SBP treatment, and to discover potential metabolic biomarkers for the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation. An untargeted metabolomics strategy based on UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS was performed to reveal the differential serum metabolites between MODSE patients with malnutrition (n=59) and healthy controls (n=33), and those between patients treated with enteral nutrition (n=31) and SBP combined with enteral nutrition (n=28).

Currently, beta-hydroxybutyric acid is the gold standard for determining ketosis in cows; however, as this method is only applicable postpartum, it is not conducive to the early intervention of ketosis in dairy cows. In this study, the sera of dry, periparturient, postpartum ketotic, and healthy cows were analyzed by both transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques. Moreover, changes of gene expression and metabolites were observed, and serum physiological and biochemical indexes were detected by ELISA. The purpose was to screen biomarkers that can be used to detect the incidence of dry or periparturient ketosis in cows. The results showed that ketotic cows had increased levels of glycolipid metabolism indexes, oxidizing factors, and inflammatory factors during dry periods and liver damage, which could be used as early biomarkers to predict the onset of ketosis. Transcriptomic results yielded 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ketotic and healthy cows during dry, peripartum, and postpartum periods. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these DEGs were involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and disease-related signaling pathways. The metabolomics sequencing results showed that ketotic cows mainly showed enrichment in tricarboxylic acid cycle, butyric acid metabolism, carbon metabolism, lysine degradation, fatty acid degradation, and other signaling pathways. Metabolites differed between ketotic and healthy cows in dry, pre-parturition, and post-parturition periods. Combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses identified significant enrichment in the glucagon signaling pathway and the lysine degradation signaling pathway in dry, periparturient, and postpartum ketotic cows.

Current screening options such as cytology or human papillomavirus testing have limitations, creating a need to identify more effective ancillary biomarkers for triage. Here, we evaluated whether metabolomic analysis of cervical mucus metabolism could be used to identify biomarkers of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. The case-control group consisted of 181 CIN, 69 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients, and 48 healthy controls in the primary cohort. We undertook metabolomic analyses using ultra-HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to profile metabolite characteristics, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified biomarker candidates. Five metabolites conferred the highest discriminatory power for SCC: oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (area under the ROC curve, 0.924; 95% confidence interval, 0.877-0.971), malic acid (0.914, 0.859-0.968), kynurenine (0.884, 0.823-0.945), GSSG/glutathione (GSH) (0.936, 0.892-0.979), and kynurenine/tryptophan (0.909, 0.856-0.961).

Additionally, metabolomic analyses revealed eight pathways strongly associated with cervical neoplasia. Of these, only the tricarboxylic acid cycle was strongly associated with all CINs and cancer, indicating active energy production. Aberrant arginine metabolism by decreasing arginine and increasing citrulline might reduce tumor immunity.

Serum metabolic fingerprints are examined via an automated nanoparticle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry platform outstanding by its rapid detection speed (measured in seconds), minimal sample consumption (in nanoliters), and cost-effectiveness (approximately $3). A panel of 14&#xa0;m&#xa0;z<sup>-1</sup> features is identified as biomarkers for TB diagnosis and a panel of 4&#xa0;m&#xa0;z<sup>-1</sup> features for TB phenotyping. Based on the acquired biomarkers, TB metabolic models are constructed through advanced machine learning algorithms. The robust metabolic model yields a 97.8% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.964-0.986) area under the curve (AUC) in TB diagnosis and an 85.7% (95% CI, 0.806-0.891) AUC in phenotyping. In this study, serum metabolic biomarker panels are revealed and develop an accurate metabolic tool with desirable diagnostic performance for TB diagnosis and phenotyping, which may expedite the effective implementation of the end-TB strategy.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

In recent years, the integration of various omics approaches, including transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics, miRNAomics, and metabolomics, has revolutionized the study of these conditions. This systematic review summarised the findings from studies that investigated reproductive disease biomarkers in both male and female cattle. After extracting 6137 studies according to exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 60 studies were included in this review. All studies identified were associated with female cattle and none were related to reproductive diseases in bulls. The analysis highlights specific biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and microbial compositions associated with bovine reproductive disease conditions, providing valuable insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-8, IL-4, IL-6, TNF&#x3b1; and acute-phase response proteins such as SAA and HP have been identified as promising biomarkers for bovine reproductive diseases. However, further research is needed to validate these markers clinically and to explore potential strategies for improving cow reproductive health. The role of bulls as carriers of venereal diseases has been underestimated in the current literature and therefore needs more attention to understand their impact on infectious reproductive diseases of female cattle.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

The strategy was successfully applied to identify dietary intake biomarkers in fecal samples from pigs fed two doses of a polyphenol-rich fruit and vegetable (FV) diet following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommendations. Potential biomarkers were identified among dietary treatment groups using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) based on a non-targeted metabolomic approach with metabolic pathway and network analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed significant differences in fecal metabolite profiles between the control and two FV intervention groups, indicating a diet-induced differential fecal metabolite profile after FV intervention. Metabolites from common flavonoids, e.g., (epi)catechin and protocatechuic acid, or unique flavonoids, e.g., 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavone and 3,5,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavone, were identified as highly discriminating factors, confirming their potential as fecal markers for the FV dietary intervention. Microbiota pathway prediction using targeted flavonoids provided valuable and reliable biomarker exploration with high confidence. A correlation network analysis between these discriminatory ion features was applied to find connections to possible dietary biomarkers, further validating these biomarkers with biochemical insights. This study demonstrates that integrating metabolic pathways and network analysis with a non-targeted metabolomic approach is highly effective for rapid and accurate identification and prediction of fecal biomarkers under controlled dietary conditions in animal studies.

Under this circumstance, improved prevention and treatment of CAD may result from knowing the connection between metabolites and CAD. This study aims to delve into the causal relationship between human metabolic biomarkers and CAD by using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Utilizing two-sample bidirectional MR analysis, we assessed the correlation between 1400 blood metabolites and CAD, and the metabolites data from the CLSA, encompassing 8299 participants. Metabolite analysis identified 1091 plasma metabolites and 309 ratios as instrumental variables. To evaluate the causal link between metabolites and CAD, we analyzed three datasets: ebi-a-GCST005195 (547,261 European &amp; East Asian samples), bbj-a-159 (29,319 East Asian CAD cases &amp; 183,134 East Asian controls), and ebi-a-GCST005194 (296,525 European &amp; East Asian samples). To estimate causal links, we utilized the IVW method. To conduct sensitivity analysis, we used MR-Egger, Weighted Median, and MR-PRESSO. Additionally, we employed MR-Egger interception and Cochran's Q statistic to assess potential heterogeneity and pleiotropy. What's more, replication and reverse analyses were performed to verify the reliability of the results and the causal order between metabolites and disease. Furthermore, we conducted a pathway analysis to identify potential metabolic pathways. 59 blood metabolites and 27 metabolite ratios nominally associated with CAD (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) were identified by IVW analysis method.

Our retrospective analysis involved 1095 postmortem femoral blood samples, including 150 hypothermia cases, 278 matched controls, and 667 randomly selected test cases, analyzed using UHPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry. The model demonstrated robustness with an R2 and Q2 value of 0.73 and 0.68, achieving 94% classification accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 96% specificity. Discriminative metabolite patterns, including acylcarnitines, stress hormones, and NAD metabolites, along with identified pathways, suggest that metabolomics analysis can be helpful to diagnose fatal hypothermia. Exposure to cold seems to trigger a stress response in the body, increasing cortisol production to maintain core temperature, possibly explaining the observed upregulation of cortisol levels and alterations in metabolic markers related to renal function.

While a number of biomarkers for renal DDIs have been described so far, multiple criteria for valid biomarkers have frequently not been investigated, for example, specificity, metabolism, or food effects. Therefore, there is a need for novel biomarkers of renal DDIs. Here, we investigated the global metabolomic effects following the administration of two classical inhibitors of renal transport proteins [cimetidine (OCT2/MATEs), probenecid (OATs)] in human plasma and urine of healthy volunteers. Additionally, we investigated metabolomic effects of two inhibitors of other transporters [verapamil (P-glycoprotein), rifampin (organic anion transporting polypeptides)] as controls. This analysis shows that both cimetidine and probenecid affect compounds involved in caffeine metabolism, carnitines, and sulfates. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the effects of all four inhibitors on endogenous compounds identified multiple promising new sensitive and specific biomarker candidates for OCT2/MATE- or OAT-mediated DDIs.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), activated upon binding various tryptophan metabolites, modulates host immune responses. This study investigates whether the metabolic diversity-the concentration distribution-of bacterial indole pathway metabolites can differentiate bacterial strains and classify ME/CFS samples. A fast targeted liquid chromatography-parallel reaction monitoring method at a rate of 4 minutes per sample was developed for large-scale analysis. This method revealed significant metabolic differences in indole derivatives among <i>B. uniformis</i> strains cultured from human isolates. Principal component analysis identified two major components (PC1, 68.9%; PC2, 18.7%), accounting for 87.6% of the variance and distinguishing two distinct <i>B. uniformis</i> clusters. The metabolic difference between clusters was particularly evident in the relative contributions of indole-3-acrylate and indole-3-aldehyde. We further measured concentration distributions of indole derivatives in ME/CFS by analyzing fecal samples from 10 patients and 10 healthy controls using the fast targeted metabolomics method. An AdaBoost-LOOCV model achieved moderate classification success with a mean LOOCV accuracy of 0.65 (Control: precision of 0.67, recall of 0.60, F1-score of 0.63; ME/CFS: precision of 0.64, recall of 0.7000, F1-score of 0.67).

Studies are needed to investigate circulating blood biomarkers to elucidate disease pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in circulating blood metabolites in CPUO patients and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Our cross-sectional study collected plasma from 11 CPUO patients and 11 matched control patients for mass-spectrometry based metabolite data analysis. 15 metabolites differed significantly in the blood of CPUO patients compared to controls, including nine amino acids (isoleucine, L-tyrosine, threonine, DL-tryptophan, L-valine, methionine, glycine, lysine, and L-phenylalanine), four amino acid derivatives (creatinine, DL-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and indole-3-acrylic acid), and two aromatic and fatty acid derivatives (2-hydroxycinnamic acid and oleamide). These metabolites were also correlated with itch severity. Metabolic set enrichment analysis (MSEA) identified downregulation of several pathways in CPUO: phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan biosynthesis; catecholamine biosynthesis; and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Our study identified decreases in several circulating plasma metabolites in CPUO patients and downregulation of pathways related to catecholamine biosynthesis and tryptophan biosynthesis, providing insight into the pathogenesis of CPUO.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Seven differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (ADIRF, EPS8L1, PRCP, CD81, PTPRD, CSK, LOC100736569) and six differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) (adenosine, beclomethasone, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, urea, 1-methyl-l-histidine, and palmitic acid) were also identified in WGCNA significant modules. Joint pathway analysis revealed that three DEPs (GART, ADCY7, and NTPCR) and two DEMs (urea and adenosine) were involved in purine metabolism. Our results suggested that there was significant correlation between proteins and metabolites, such as IL4I1 and urea (<i>r</i> = 0.86).

Alterations in sebum, the lipid-rich mixture coating the skin surface, correlate with age, sex, ethnicity, diet, exercise, and disease state, making the skin surface an ideal sample source for future noninvasive biomarker exploration, disease diagnosis, and forensic investigation. The potential of sebum sampling has been realized primarily via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), an ideal approach to assess the skin surface lipidome. However, a better understanding of sebum collection and subsequent ESI-MS analysis is required before skin surface sampling can be implemented in routine analyses. Challenges include ambiguity in definitive lipid identification, inherent biological variability in sebum production, and methodological, technical variability in analyses. To overcome these obstacles, avoid common pitfalls, and achieve reproducible, robust outcomes, every portion of the workflow-from sample collection to data analysis-should be carefully considered with the specific application in mind. This review details current practices in sebum sampling, sample preparation, ESI-MS data acquisition, and data analysis, and it provides important considerations in acquiring meaningful lipidomic datasets from the skin surface.

However, there has not been a comprehensive study of its flavor or the relationship between sensory and bioactive compounds. To address this issue, we examined AOF's microstructure, flavor, and metabolomic profiles during fruit maturation. The key markers used to distinguish samples included fruit expansion, testa pigmentation, aril liquefaction, oil cell expansion, peel spiciness, aril sweetness, and seed bitterness. A full-spectrum metabolomic analysis, combining a nontargeted metabolomics approach for volatile compounds and a widely targeted metabolomics approach for nonvolatile compounds, identified 1,448 metabolites, including 1,410 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). Notably, 31 DAMs, including nootkatone, were associated with spicy peel, sweet aril, and bitter seeds. Correlational analysis indicated that bitterness intensity is an easy-to-use biomarker for nootkatone content in seeds. KEGG enrichment analysis linked peel spiciness to phenylpropanoid and capsaicin biosynthesis, seed bitterness to terpenoid (especially nootkatone) biosynthesis, and aril sweetness to starch and sucrose metabolism.

Here we report changes, detected by untargeted LC-MS, in the plasma lipid profiles of male C57Bl/6JRj mice following the PO and IV administration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib. Statistical analysis of the data obtained for both the IV and PO samples showed time-related changes in the amounts of lipids from several different classes. The largest effects were associated with a rapid onset of these changes following gefitinib administration followed by a gradual return by 24&#xa0;h post dose to the type of lipid profile seen in predose samples. Investigation of the lipids responsible for the variance observed in the data showed that the PI, PC, LPC, PE and TG were subject to the largest disruption with both transient increases and decreases in relative amounts seen in response to administration of the drug. The pattern of the changes in the relative abundances of those lipids subject to variation appeared to be correlated to the pharmacokinetics of gefitinib (and its major metabolites).

This study intended to construct a predictive model for AMI utilizing metabolomics data and an explainable machine learning approach called Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM). The EBM model was trained on a dataset of 102 prognostic metabolites gathered from 99 individuals, including 34 healthy controls and 65 AMI patients.

The EBM model displayed satisfactory performance in predicting AMI, with various classification performance metrics. The model's predictions were based on the combined effects of individual metabolites and their interactions. In this context, the results obtained in two different EBM modeling, including both only individual metabolite features and their interaction effects, were discussed.

Identification of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets has been a focal challenge in PPRS prevention and control. By integrating metabolomic and lipidomic serum analyses of clinical pig cohorts through a machine learning approach with in vivo and in vitro infection models, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is discovered as a serum metabolic biomarker for PRRS virus (PRRSV) clinical diagnosis. PRRSV promoted LPA synthesis by upregulating the autotaxin expression, which causes innate immunosuppression by dampening the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and type I interferon responses, leading to enhanced virus replication. Targeting LPA demonstrated protection against virus infection and associated disease outcomes in infected pigs, indicating that LPA is a novel antiviral target against PRRSV. This study lays a foundation for clinical prevention and control of PRRSV infections.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

LC-MS and olink proteomics were employed for obtaining plasma metabolomics profiling and inflammatory protein profiles. Patients were classified into responders and non-responders based on drug efficacy. Enrichment analyses of differential metabolites and proteins of the responders at baseline and after treatment were conducted to study the mechanism of drug action. Differential metabolites and proteins between the two groups were screened as biomarkers to predict the drug efficacy. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of biomarkers. The changes in metabolites and inflammatory proteins in responders after treatment reflected the mechanism of FDJG treatment for KBD, which may act on glycerophospholipid metabolism, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

The acquired data confirmed that patients' stratification based on smoking status impacted the discriminating ability of the identified LC marker candidates. Analyzing a validation set of samples enabled us to determine if the putative LC markers were truly robust. It demonstrated significant differences in the case of four metabolites: allantoin, glutamic acid, succinic acid, and sphingosine-1-phosphate.

Although the mechanisms remain debated, CBD is known to induce drug-responsive changes in lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters. Lipid aberrations are also frequently observed with antipsychotics, which may contribute to their efficacy or increase the risk of undesirables, including metabolic dysfunction, obesity and dyslipidaemia. Our study investigated CBD's impact following lipid responses triggered by interaction with second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) in a randomized phase I safety study. Untargeted mass spectrometry assessed the lipidomic profiles of human sera, collected from 38 healthy volunteers. Serum samples were obtained prior to commencement of any medication (t = 0), 3 days after consecutive administration of one of the five, placebo-controlled, treatment arms designed to achieve steady-state concentrations of each SGA (amisulpride, 150 mg/day; quetiapine, 300 mg/day; olanzapine 10 mg/day; risperidone, 3 mg/day), and after six successive days of SGA treatment combined with CBD (800 mg/day). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) refined 3712 features to a putative list of 15 lipids significantly altered (AUC &gt; 0.7), classified into sphingolipids (53 %), glycerolipids (27 %) and glycerophospholipids (20 %). Targeted mass spectrometry confirmed reduced sphingomyelin and ceramide levels with antipsychotics, which mapped along their catabolic pathway and were restored by CBD. These sphingolipids inversely correlated with body weight after olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone treatment, where CBD appears to have arrested or attenuated these effects.

In forensic pathology, structural proteins of the cellular compartments of the CNS in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been predominantly used so far as markers of an acute trauma reaction for the biochemical assessment of neuropathological changes after TBI. The analysis of endogenous metabolites offers an innovative approach that has not yet been considered widely in the assessment of causes and circumstances of death, for example after TBI. The present study, therefore, addresses the question whether the detection of metabolites by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis in post mortem CSF is suitable to identify TBI and to distinguish it from acute cardiovascular control fatalities (CVF). Metabolite analysis of 60 CSF samples collected during autopsies was performed using high resolution (HR)-LC/MS. Subsequent statistical and graphical evaluation as well as the calculation of a TBI/CVF quotient yielded promising results: numerous metabolites were identified that showed significant concentration differences in the post mortem CSF for lethal acute TBI (survival times up to 90&#xa0;min) compared to CVF. For the first time, this forensic study provides an evaluation of a new generation of biomarkers for diagnosing TBI in the differentiation to other causes of death, here CVF, as surrogate markers for the post mortem assessment of complex neuropathological processes in the CNS (\"neuroforensomics\").","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Experiment 1: 24 growing rabbits are included at 56 days of age. The rabbits are fed ad libitum one of the two experimental diets only differing in lysine levels. Experiment 2: 53 growing rabbits are included at 46 days of age, under a fasting and eating one of the five experimental diets, with identical chemical composition except for the three typically limiting amino acids (being fed commercial diets ad libitum in both experiments). Blood samples are taken for targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Here we show that the metabolic phenotype undergoes alterations when animals experience a rapid dietary shift in the amino acid levels. While some of the differential metabolites can be attributed directly to changes in specific amino acids, creatinine, urea, hydroxypropionic acid and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid are suggested as a biomarker of amino acid imbalances in growing rabbits' diets, since its changes are not attributable to a single amino acid. The fluctuations in their levels suggest intricate amino acid interactions.

Culture media samples with known implantation outcomes were collected after blastocyst embryo transfer (including both PGT and non-PGT cycles) and were analyzed using chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. The spectra were processed and analyzed using statistical and machine learning techniques to identify biomarkers associated with embryo implantation, and to develop a predictive model.

We assessed the therapeutic potential of saffron essential oil (SEO) and elucidated its underlying mechanisms through behavioral indices and NMR-based metabolomic analysis. The findings indicate that SEO ameliorates behavioral symptoms of depression, such as the number of entries into the central area, fecal count, latency to immobility, and duration of immobility in both the Tail Suspension Test (TST) and the Forced Swim Test (FST), along with correcting the dysregulation of 5-serotonin. Metabolomic investigations identified sixteen potential biomarkers across the liver, spleen, and kidneys. SEO notably modulated nine of these biomarkers: dimethylglycine, glycerol, adenosine, &#x3b2;-glucose, &#x3b1;-glucose, uridine, mannose, sarcosine, and aspartate, with glycerol emerging as a common biomarker in both the liver and spleen. Pathway analysis suggests that these biomarkers participate in glycolysis, glycine serine threonine metabolism, and energy metabolism, potentially implicating a role in neural regulation. In summary, SEO effectively mitigates depressive-like behaviors in CRS mice, predominantly via modulation of glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism, and potentially exerts antidepressant effects through neural regulation.

Our previous study proposed novel models to predict the PMSI and cause-of-death based on metabolites of blood from rats immersed in freshwater. However, with the advance of putrefaction, it is hardly to obtain blood samples beyond 3 days postmortem. To further assess the feasibility of PMSI estimation and drowning diagnosis in the later postmortem phase, gastrocnemius, the more degradation-resistant tissue, was collected from drowned rats and postmortem submersion model in freshwater immediately after death, and at 1&#xa0;day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, and 10 days postmortem respectively. Then the samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to investigate the dynamic changes of the metabolites. A total of 924 metabolites were identified. Similar chronological changes of gastrocnemius metabolites were observed in the drowning and postmortem submersion groups. The difference in metabolic profiles between drowning and postmortem submersion groups was only evident in the initial 1&#xa0;day postmortem, which was faded as the PMSI extension. Nineteen metabolites representing temporally-dynamic patterns were selected as biomarkers for PMSI estimation.

This BA helps to improve insulin clearance by increasing the expression of the insulin-degrading enzyme, restoring sensitivity to this hormone, and making it viable for treating T2DM. Herein, a targeted metabolomic method for TUDCA determination in extracellular medium of hepatocyte matrices by micellar electrokinetic chromatography-UV was optimized, validated, and applied. The optimized background electrolyte was composed of 40&#xa0;mmol/L sodium cholate and 30&#xa0;mmol/L sodium tetraborate at pH 9.0. The following figures of merit were evaluated: linearity, limit of quantification, limit of detection, accuracy, and precision. Data obtained with the validated electrophoretic method showed a self-stimulation of TUDCA production in media supplemented only with BA. On the other hand, TUDCA concentration was reduced in the hyperlipidic medium. This suggests that, in these media, the effect of TUDCA is reduced, such as self-stimulated production and consequent regulation of glycemic homeostasis. Therefore, the results reinforce the need for investigating TUDCA as a potential T2DM biomarker as well as its use to treat several comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive with adverse effects on patients. Due to the heterogeneous nature of PCa and their multifocality, tissue biopsies often yield false-negative results. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring innovative approaches, particularly in the realms of proteomics and metabolomics, to identify more reliable biomarkers and improve PCa diagnosis. Liquid biopsy (LB) has emerged as a promising non-invasive strategy for PCa early detection, biopsy selection, active surveillance for low-risk cases, and post-treatment and progression monitoring. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-bilayer nanovesicles released by all cell types and play an important role in intercellular communication. EVs have garnered attention as a valuable biomarker resource in LB for PCa-specific biomarkers, enhancing diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment guidance. Metabolomics provides insight into the body's metabolic response to both internal and external stimuli, offering quantitative measurements of biochemical alterations. It excels at detecting non-genetic influences, aiding in the discovery of more accurate cancer biomarkers for early detection and disease progression monitoring. This review delves into the potential of EVs as a resource for LB in PCa across various clinical applications. It also explores cancer-related metabolic biomarkers, both within and outside EVs in PCa, and summarises previous metabolomic findings in PCa diagnosis and risk assessment. Finally, the article addresses the challenges and future directions in the evolving field of EV-based metabolomic analysis, offering a comprehensive overview of its potential in advancing PCa management.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Quanduzhong capsule (QDZ) is a single preparation composed of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., which is included in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. It is used to treat OP in clinical practice, but its mechanisms are unclear. This study involved 30 patients with OP, 30 healthy controls (HC), and 28 OP patients treated with QDZ to identify potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of OP and to investigate the potential mechanism of QDZ in treating OP. The serum samples were analyzed using targeted amino acid metabolomics. Significant differences in amino acid metabolism were identified between the OP cohort and the HC group, as well as between OP patients before and after QDZ treatment. Compared with HC, the serum levels of 14 amino acids in OP patients changed significantly. Kynurenine, arginine, citrulline, methionine, and their combinations are expected to be potential biomarkers for OP diagnosis. Notably, QDZ reversed the changes in levels of 10 amino acids in the serum of OP patients and significantly impacted numerous metabolic pathways during the treatment of OP.

The rapid industrialization that occurred in South Korea during the 1960s and 1970s contributed significantly to the economy of the country; however, the associated mining and refining led to considerable environmental pollution, and although mining is now in decline in South Korea, the detrimental effects on residents inhabiting the surrounding areas remain. The bioaccumulation of toxic heavy metals leads to metabolic alterations in human homeostasis, with disruptions in this balance leading to various health issues. This study used metabolomics to explore metabolomic alterations in the plasma samples of residents living in mining and refining areas. The results showed significant increases in metabolites involved in glycolysis and the surrounding metabolic pathways, such as glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate, and inosine monophosphate, in those inhabiting polluted areas. An investigation of the associations between metabolites and blood clinical parameters through meet-in-the-middle analysis indicated that female residents were more affected by heavy metal exposure, resulting in more metabolomic alterations. For women, inhabiting the abandoned mine area, metabolites in the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways, such as ribose-5-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, have shown a negative correlation with albumin and calcium. Finally, Mendelian randomization(MR) was used to determine the causal effects of these heavy metal exposure-related metabolites on heavy metal exposure-related clinical parameters. Metabolite biomarkers could provide insights into altered metabolic pathways related to exposure to toxic heavy metals and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the health effects of toxic heavy metal exposure.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

An accurate diagnosis of idiopathic PD remains challenging as misdiagnosis is common in routine clinical practice. Moreover, current therapeutics focus on symptomatic management rather than curing or slowing down disease progression. Therefore, identification of potential PD biomarkers and providing a better understanding of the underlying disease pathophysiology are urgent. Herein, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) based metabolomics approaches were used to profile the serum metabolome of 50 patients with different stages of idiopathic PD (early, mid and advanced) and 45 age-matched controls. Levels of 57 metabolites including cysteine-S-sulfate and N-acetyl tryptophan were significantly higher in patients with PD compared to controls, with lower amounts of additional 51 metabolites including vanillic acid, and N-acetylaspartic acid. Xanthines, including caffeine and its downstream metabolites, were lowered in patients with PD relative to controls indicating a potential role caffeine and its metabolites against neuronal damage. Seven metabolites, namely cysteine-S-sulfate, 1-methylxanthine, vanillic acid, N-acetylaspartic acid, 3-N-acetyl tryptophan, 5-methoxytryptophol, and 13-HODE yielded a ROC curve with a high classification accuracy (AUC 0.977). Comparison between different PD stages showed that cysteine-S-sulfate levels were significantly increasing with the advancement of PD stages while LPI 20:4 was significantly decreasing with disease progression. Our findings provide new biomarker candidates to assist in the diagnosis of PD and monitor its progression.

In this experiment, <i>R. chrysanthums</i> derived from the same origin were migrated to different culture environments (artificial climate chamber and intelligent artificial incubator) to obtain two forms of <i>R. chrysanthum</i>. After UV-B irradiation, 404 metabolites and 93,034 unigenes were detected. Twenty-six of these different metabolites were classified as UV-B-responsive metabolites. Glyceric acid is used as a potential UV-B stress biomarker. The domesticated <i>Rhododendron chrysanthum</i> Pall. had high amino acid and SOD contents. The study shows that the domesticated <i>Rhododendron chrysanthum</i> Pall. has significant UV-B resistance. The transcriptomics results show that the trends of DEGs after UV-B radiation were similar for both forms of <i>R. chrysanthum</i>: cellular process and metabolic process accounted for a higher proportion in biological processes, cellular anatomical entity accounted for the highest proportion in the cellular component, and catalytic activity and binding accounted for the highest proportion in the molecular function category. Through comparative study, the forms of metabolites resistant to UV-B stress in plants can be reflected, and UV-B radiation absorption complexes can be screened for application in future specific practices. Moreover, by comparing the differences in response to UV-B stress between the two forms of <i>R. chrysanthum</i>, references can be provided for cultivating domesticated plants with UV-B stress resistance characteristics. Research on the complex mechanism of plant adaptation to UV-B will be aided by these results.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Nutrition plays a key role in the success of European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and could be affected by the breeding status of the animals and reflected in the metabolome of this species. As nutritional needs are considerably increased during pregnancy and lactation, the main objective of this work was to determine how the breeding status (pregnant and lactating) of European wild rabbit does affects nutritional requirements and their metabolome (using targeted and untargeted metabolomics), aiming to find a useful biomarker of breeding status and for monitoring nutritional requirements. To address this gap, 60 wild European rabbits were studied. Animals were divided according to their breeding status and only pregnant (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) and lactating (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;11) rabbit does were used (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;29 in total). The body weight and length of each animal were analyzed. The relative and absolute chemical composition of the gastric content and whole blood sample were taken, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics were analyzed. As a main result, there were no differences in biometric measurements, gastric content, and targeted metabolomics, except for live weight and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), as pregnant animals showed higher live weight (+12%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0234) and lower NEFA acid levels (-46%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0262) than lactating females. Regarding untargeted metabolomics, a good differentiation of the metabolome of the two breeding groups was confirmed, and it was proven that pregnant animals showed higher plasmatic levels of succinic anhydride (3.48 more times; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0236), succinic acid (succinate) (3.1 more times; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0068) and propionic acid (3.98 more times; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0121) than lactating animals.

The gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is laparoscopy, which is invasive and accompanied by several risks. Currently, there are no effective non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis. Here, we investigated whether metabolites whose levels are altered in patients with endometriosis hold potential as diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. This case-control study involved 32 patients with endometriosis and 29 patients with other benign gynecological disease. The diagnosis of all patients was confirmed through postoperative histopathological examination, and the patients were divided into two groups: an endometriosis group (EM) and a control group. Fasting blood was collected and used for non-targeted metabolomic-based detection. The data were processed through principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and significance analysis of microarrays. A univariate receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the metabolites. The metabolite profiles of patients with endometriosis were markedly different compared with those of the controls. In addition, several metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arginine biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism, were altered. Ornithine and medorinone showed better potential as biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis than CA125. We analyzed the altered metabolic profiles in patients with endometriosis and found ornithine and medorinone as potential non-invasive biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis, whereas the combined ornithine-medorinone diagnosis is more valuable. These findings may help advance research on non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for endometriosis. Further research with an improved study design and a larger cohort should be performed to confirm the diagnostic potential and clinical application of these biomarkers.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Although sphingolipids play key roles in cells, only the effects of fumonisins on the sphingolipidome are well-documented. In chickens, fumonisins have been shown to increase the sphinganine to sphingosine ratio and the C22-24:C16 sphingolipid ratio, which has been proposed as a new biomarker of toxicity. In this study, we used UHPLC-MSMS targeted analysis to measure the effect of fusariotoxins on sphingolipids in the livers of chickens fed with diets containing fusariotoxins administered individually and in combination, at the maximum levels recommended by the European Commission. Chickens were exposed from hatching until they reached 35 days of age. This study revealed for the first time that fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone alone and in combination have numerous effects on the sphingolipidome in chicken livers. A 30-50&#xa0;% decrease in ceramide, dihydroceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin, monohexosylceramide and lactosylceramide measured at the class level was observed when fusariotoxins were administered alone, whereas a 30-100&#xa0;% increase in dihydroceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin, and monohexosylceramide was observed when the fusariotoxins were administered in combination. For these different variables, strong significant interactions were observed between fumonisins and zearalenone and between fumonisins and deoxynivalenol, whereas interactions between deoxynivalenol and zearalenone were less frequent and less significant. Interestingly, an increase in the C22-24:C16 ratio of ceramides, sphingomyelins, and monohexosylceramides was observed in chickens fed the diets containing fumonisins only, and this increase was close when the toxin was administered alone or in combination with deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. This effect mainly corresponded to a decrease in sphingolipids with a fatty acid chain length of 16 carbons, whereas C22-24 sphingolipids were unaffected or increased. In conclusion the C22-24:C16 ratio emerged as a specific biomarker, with variations dependent only on the presence of fumonisins.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Breakthroughs in omics methodologies and the power of bioinformatics have created an excellent opportunity to apply technological advances to clinical needs, for instance in the development of precision biomarkers for personalised medicine. Via omics technologies, biological processes from the genes to circulating protein, as well as the microbiome - including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can be investigated on an axis. However, there are important barriers to omics-based biomarker discovery and validation, including the use of semi-quantitative measurements from untargeted platforms, which may exhibit high analytical, inter- and intra-individual variance. Standardising methods and the need to validate them across diverse populations presents a challenge, partly due to disease complexity and the dynamic nature of biomarker expression at different disease stages. Lack of validity causes lost opportunities when studies fail to provide the knowledge needed for regulatory approvals, all of which contributes to a delayed translation of these discoveries into clinical practice.

Our results showed significant changes in plasma metabolism between patients with these mental disorders and HCs; the most distinct changes were observed in SCZ patients. Moreover, the metabolic differences in BD patients shared features with those in both MDD and SCZ, although the BD metabolic profile was closer to that of MDD than to SCZ.

Results suggest that KYN and TRP may be markers for healing in individuals with CVLUs. <b>Innovation and Conclusion:</b> Gaining a better understanding of the associations between the TRP-l-KYN pathway and the healing of CVLUs may help to clarify the links of inflammation with the rate and success of wound healing. Biomarker development focused on the TRP-l-KYN pathway could be pursued, if the associations are further supported by focused research studies.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

With its minimal invasive nature and comprehensive range of analytes, urine has established itself as a clinical diagnostic tool for various disorders, including renal, urological, metabolic, and endocrine diseases. Furthermore, urine's unique attributes make it an attractive matrix for biomarker discovery, as well as in assessing the metabolic and physiological states of patients and healthy individuals alike. However, limitations in our knowledge of average values and sources of urinary lipids decrease the wider clinical application of urinary lipidomics. In this context, untargeted lipidomics analysis relies heavily on the extraction and analysis of lipids in biological samples. Nevertheless, this type of analysis presents challenges in lipid identification due to the diverse nature of lipids. Therefore, proper sample treatment before analysis is crucial to obtain robust and reproducible lipidomic profiles. To address this gap, we conducted a comparative study of a urine pool sample collected from twenty healthy volunteers using four different lipid extraction methods: one biphasic and three monophasic protocols. The extracted lipids were then analyzed using UHPLC-MS and MS/MS, and the semi-quantification of all the accurately annotated lipid species was performed for each extraction method.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

A total of 60 and 61 Chinese male participants aged &#x2265;80 years were recruited to the metabolome and validation cohorts, respectively. The baPWV of participants was measured using an automatic waveform analyzer. Plasma metabolic profile was investigated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry. Orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) regression modeling established the association between metabolic profile and baPWV to determine important metabolites predictive of vascular aging. Additionally, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to validate the metabolites in plasma and culture media of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. OPLS modeling identified 14 and 22 metabolites inversely and positively associated with baPWV, respectively. These 36 biomarkers were significantly enriched in seven metabolite sets, especially in cysteine and methionine metabolism (p &lt;0.05). Notably, among metabolites involved in cysteine and methionine metabolism, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) level was inversely related to baPWV, with a significant correlation coefficient in the OPLS model (p &lt;0.05).

A systematic evaluation of the data processing methods is crucial to identify adequate processing procedures for a given experimental setup. Current comparative studies are mostly focused on peak area data but not on absolute concentrations. In this study, we evaluated data processing methods to produce outputs that were most similar to the corresponding absolute quantified data. We examined the data distribution characteristics, fold difference patterns between 2 metabolites, and sample variance. We used 2 metabolomic datasets from a retail milk study and a lupus nephritis cohort as test cases. When studying the impact of data normalization, transformation, scaling, and combinations of these methods, we found that the cross-contribution compensating multiple standard normalization (ccmn) method, followed by square root data transformation, was most appropriate for a well-controlled study such as the milk study dataset. Regarding the lupus nephritis cohort study, only ccmn normalization could slightly improve the data quality of the noisy cohort. Since the assessment accounted for the resemblance between processed data and the corresponding absolute quantified data, our results denote a helpful guideline for processing metabolomic datasets within a similar context (food and clinical metabolomics).

First, the serum amino acid metabolism profiles of 44 patients with HF and 30 healthy controls (Con) were quantitatively measured. Then, candidate markers were identified through the utilization of T test, multivariate statistical analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The results found that there were 11 amino acid levels that were significantly different between patients with HF and Con.

To account for potential confounders, data were filtered for age and BMI correlations. The statistical analysis employed supervised and unsupervised multivariate data analysis techniques, including a principal component analysis (PCA), a partial least squares discriminant analysis (oPLS-DA) and a random forest (RF). To determine whether the significant absolute differences in the lipid subspecies have a relevant effect on the overall composition of the respective lipid classes, we introduce a class composition visualization (CCV). We identified 670 lipids across 16 classes. PwMS showed a significant increase in diacylglycerols (DAG), with DAG 16:0;0_18:1;0 being proven to be the lipid with the highest predictive ability for MS as determined by RF. The alterations in the phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) were mainly linked to RRMS while the alterations in the ether-bound PEs (PE O-) were found in chronic progressive MS. The amount of CE species was reduced in the CPMS cohort whereas TAG species were reduced in the RRMS patients, both lipid classes being relevant in lipid storage. Combining the above mentioned data analyses, distinct lipidomic signatures were isolated and shown to be correlated with clinical phenotypes.

Recent studies have indicated that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of asthma. However, the metabolic profile of ILC2s and their regulatory mechanisms in asthma remain unclear. Therefore, we established two asthma mouse models: an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model and an IL-33-induced asthma model. We then used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) to conduct high-throughput untargeted metabolic analysis of ILC2s in the lung tissues of the asthma models. The identified metabolites primarily consisted of lipids, lipid-like molecules, benzene, organic acids, derivatives, and organic oxidation compounds. Specifically, 34 differentially accumulated metabolites influenced the metabolic profiles of the control and OVA-induced asthma model groups. Moreover, the accumulation of 39 metabolites significantly differed between the Interleukin 33 (IL-33) and control groups. These differentially accumulated metabolites were mainly involved in pathways such as sphingolipid, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism. This metabolomic study revealed, for the first time, the key metabolites and metabolic pathways of ILC2s, revealing new aspects of cellular metabolism in the context of airway inflammation. These findings not only contribute to unraveling the pathogenesis of asthma but also provide a crucial theoretical foundation for the future development of therapeutic strategies targeting ILC2s.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

While biomarker-based assessment often relies on a single molecule, metabolic profiling combines several metabolites to create a more complex and more specific fingerprint of the disease. However, in contrast to genomics, there is no unique metabolomics setup able to measure the entire metabolome. This challenge leads to tedious and resource consuming preliminary studies to be able to design the right metabolomics experiment. In that context, computer assisted metabolic profiling can be of strong added value to design metabolomics studies more quickly and efficiently. We propose a constraint-based modelling approach which predicts in silico profiles of metabolites that are more likely to be differentially abundant under a given metabolic perturbation (e.g. due to a genetic disease), using flux simulation. In genome-scale metabolic networks, the fluxes of exchange reactions, also known as the flow of metabolites through their external transport reactions, can be simulated and compared between control and disease conditions in order to calculate changes in metabolite import and export. These import/export flux differences would be expected to induce changes in circulating biofluid levels of those metabolites, which can then be interpreted as potential biomarkers or metabolites of interest. In this study, we present SAMBA (SAMpling Biomarker Analysis), an approach which simulates fluxes in exchange reactions following a metabolic perturbation using random sampling, compares the simulated flux distributions between the baseline and modulated conditions, and ranks predicted differentially exchanged metabolites as potential biomarkers for the perturbation. We show that there is a good fit between simulated metabolic exchange profiles and experimental differential metabolites detected in plasma, such as patient data from the disease database OMIM, and metabolic trait-SNP associations found in mGWAS studies. These biomarker recommendations can provide insight into the underlying mechanism or metabolic pathway perturbation lying behind observed metabolite differential abundances, and suggest new metabolites as potential avenues for further experimental analyses.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

The disease is caused by six species of Schistosoma blood fluke; five of which cause intestinal granulomatous inflammation and bleeding. The current diagnostic method is inaccurate and delayed, hence, biomarker identification using metabolomics has been applied. However, previous studies only investigated infection caused by one Schistosoma spp., leaving a gap in the use of biomarkers for other species. No study focused on understanding the progression of intestinal disease. Therefore, we aimed to identify early gut biomarkers of infection with three Schistosoma spp. and progression of intestinal pathology. We infected 3 groups of mice, 3 mice each, with Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum or Schistosoma mekongi and collected their feces before and 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after infection. Metabolites in feces were extracted and identified using mass spectrometer-based metabolomics. Metabolites were annotated and analyzed with XCMS bioinformatics tool and Metaboanalyst platform. From &gt;36,000 features in all conditions, multivariate analysis found a distinct pattern at each time point for all species. Pathway analysis reported alteration of several lipid metabolism pathways as infection progressed. Disturbance of the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway was found with the presence of parasite eggs, indicating involvement of this pathway in disease progression. Biomarkers were discovered using a combination of variable importance for projection score cut-off and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

In this study, we developed an untargeted metabolomics method for plasma and fecal samples with the optimization and evaluation of these factors. Our results showed that optimizing the reconstitution solvent and sample injection amount was critical for achieving the balance between metabolites coverage and signal linearity. Method validation with representative stable isotopically labeled standards (SILs) provided insights into the analytical performance evaluation of our method. To tackle the issue of the matrix effect, we implemented a postcolumn infusion (PCI) approach to monitor the overall absolute matrix effect (AME) and relative matrix effect (RME). The monitoring revealed distinct AME and RME profiles in plasma and feces. Comparing RME data obtained for SILs through postextraction spiking with those monitored using PCI compounds demonstrated the comparability of these two methods for RME assessment. Therefore, we applied the PCI approach to predict the RME of 305 target compounds covered in our in-house library and found that targets detected in the negative polarity were more vulnerable to the RME, regardless of the sample matrix. Given the value of this PCI approach in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of our method in terms of the matrix effect, we recommend implementing a PCI approach during method development and applying it routinely in untargeted metabolomics.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

The exact consequence of accumulating lcFAO-intermediates and their influence on cellular lipid homeostasis is, however, still unknown. To investigate the fate and cellular effects of the accumulating lcFAO-intermediates and to explore the presence of disease-specific markers, we used tracer-based lipidomics with deuterium-labeled oleic acid (D9-C18:1) in lcFAOD patient-derived fibroblasts.

Some of the resulting BDA-derived metabolites have been proposed as potential exposure biomarkers of furan. However, the lack of quantification for recognized and feasible furan biomarkers has hampered the development of internal exposure risk assessment of furan. In this study, we employed reliable non-targeted metabolomics techniques to uncover urinary furan metabolites and elucidate their chemical structures. We characterized 8 reported and 11 new furan metabolites derived from the binding of BDA with glutathione (GSH), biogenic amines, and/or amino acids in the urine of male rats subjected to varying doses of furan.

Cyclic GSH-BDA demonstrated a robust mass spectrometry ion response intensity and exhibited evident time- and dose response.

We concentrated on the augmented value of the metabolomic profile in differentiating long-term survival from short-term survival in patients with NSCLC subjected to ICIs. We prospectively recruited 97 patients with stage IV NSCLC who were treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitor, including patients treated with monoimmunotherapy as second-line treatment (Cohort 1), and patients treated with combination immunotherapy as first-line treatment (Cohort 2).

These observations suggest that AzA is an endogenous substrate of both OATP1B3 and P-gp, and may serve as a potential endogenous biomarker for the assessment of the function of OATP1B3-P-gp for the prediction of changes in the pharmacokinetics of drugs transported by OATP1B3-P-gp in liver disease states.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) imaging is a potent and sensitive MS ionization technique for direct, unaltered 2D and 3D imaging of metabolites in complex biological samples. Indeed, DESI gently desorbs and ionizes analyte molecules from the sample surface using an electrospray source of highly charged aqueous spray droplets in ambient conditions. DESI-MS imaging of biological samples allows untargeted analysis and characterization of metabolites in liver cancers to identify new biomarkers of malignancy. In this chapter, we described a detailed protocol using liver cancer samples collected and stored for histopathology examination, either as frozen or as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Such hepatocellular carcinoma samples can be subjected to DESI-MS analyses, illustrating the capacity of spatially resolved metabolomics to distinguish malignant lesions from adjacent normal liver tissue.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Metabolic dysfunction is one of AD risk factors, which leaded to alterations of various metabolites in the body. Pathological changes of the brain can be reflected in blood metabolites that are expected to explain the disease mechanisms or be candidate biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of targeted metabolites within peripheral blood of AD mouse model, with the purpose of exploring the disease mechanism and potential biomarkers. Targeted metabolomics was used to quantify 256 metabolites in serum of triple transgenic AD (3&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;Tg-AD) male mice. Compared with controls, 49 differential metabolites represented dysregulation in purine, pyrimidine, tryptophan, cysteine and methionine and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Among them, adenosine, serotonin, N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, and acetylcholine play a key role in regulating neural transmitter network. The alteration of S-adenosine-L-homocysteine, S-adenosine-L-methionine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide in AD mice serum can served as indicator of AD risk. The results revealed the changes of metabolites in serum, suggesting that metabolic dysregulation in periphery in AD mice may be related to the disturbances in neuroinhibition, the serotonergic system, sleep function, the cholinergic system, and the gut microbiota. This study provides novel insights into the dysregulation of several key metabolites and metabolic pathways in AD, presenting potential avenues for future research and the development of peripheral biomarkers.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Chronic HCV infection is a major cause of liver fibrosis, and evaluation of liver fibrosis is essential because the prognosis of patients with chronic HCV infection is closely related to the stage of fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is traditionally evaluated based on pathological analysis of biopsy specimens, which is considered the gold standard. Nevertheless, liver biopsy is invasive and susceptible to sampling error and inter- and intraobserver variation in pathological interpretation; it is also costly. Therefore, noninvasive diagnostic investigations have been developed, including the use of fibrotic markers, scoring systems based on routine blood tests, and transient elastography with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography. Recently, metabolomics, an emerging technology, has been used to detect the fibrosis stage. In this editorial, I comment on the article titled \"Metabolomics in chronic hepatitis C: Decoding fibrosis grading and underlying pathways\" by Ferrasi <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Hepatology</i>.

If this is the case, forensic investigations are faced with a significant shortage of evidence and information regarding the unknown perpetrator and/or victim as well as any missing persons. However, a rather commonly found biological trace encountered at crime scenes is human hair. As hair acts as a biochemical reservoir, it may contain valuable information regarding one's characteristics and habits. This study aimed to build an analytical method capable of determining a marker set of relevant metabolites in hair, eventually building up a profile of its donor. To find potential markers, an untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to select and identify statistically significant features. For that purpose, a total of 68 hair samples were collected at several hairdresser shops in varying neighbourhoods. Compound extraction was achieved via methanolic incubation overnight and analysis performed using a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) Orbitrap Q Exactive Focus. The acquired data was uploaded and statistically evaluated using two free online software/libraries, where a total of eight compounds have given a match on both tools. Their presumptive identity was confirmed using reference standards and consequently added to a dynamic target donor profiling list. These results show the potential of using untargeted metabolomics for the search for lifestyle biomarkers capable of differentiating individuals.

Thus, the aim of the study was to discover molecular changes characteristic of antiangiogenesis and developmental toxicity. We exposed ZFEs to two antiangiogenic drugs (SU4312, sorafenib) and two developmental toxicants (methotrexate, rotenone) with putative antiangiogenic action. Molecular changes were measured by performing untargeted metabolomics in single embryos. The metabolome response was accompanied by the occurrence of morphological alterations. Two distinct metabolic effect patterns were observed. The first pattern comprised common effects of two specific angiogenesis inhibitors and the known teratogen methotrexate, strongly suggesting a shared mode of action of antiangiogenesis and developmental toxicity. The second pattern involved joint effects of methotrexate and rotenone, likely related to disturbances in energy metabolism. The metabolites of the first pattern, such as phosphatidylserines, pterines, retinol, or coenzyme Q precursors, represented potential links to antiangiogenesis and related developmental toxicity.

Cartilage development is critical to longitudinal elongation of individual vertebrae. This study isolated primary porcine vertebral chondrocytes (PVCs) to clarify the complex mechanisms of elongation. We used transcriptome and target energy metabolome technologies to confirm crucial genes and metabolites in primary PVCs at different differentiation stages (0, 4, 8, and 12 days). Pairwise comparisons of the four stages identified 4566 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Time-series gene cluster and functional analyses of these DEGs revealed four clusters related to metabolic processes, cartilage development, vascular development, and cell cycle regulation. We constructed a transcriptional regulatory network determining chondrocyte maturation. The network indicated that significantly enriched transcription factor (TF) families, including zf-C2H2, homeobox, TF_bZIP, and RHD, are important in cell cycle and differentiation processes. Further, dynamic network biomarker (DNB) analysis revealed that day 4 was the tipping point for chondrocyte development, consistent with morphological and metabolic changes. We found 24 DNB DEGs, including the TFs <i>NFATC2</i> and <i>SP7.</i> Targeted energy metabolome analysis showed that most metabolites were elevated throughout chondrocyte development; notably, 16 differentially regulated metabolites (DRMs) were increased at three time points after cell differentiation. In conclusion, integrated metabolome and transcriptome analyses highlighted the importance of amino acid biosynthesis in chondrocyte development, with coordinated regulation of DEGs and DRMs promoting PVC differentiation via glucose oxidation.

The liver injury model of mice was established using acetaminophen (APAP). The protective effect of MII on the mice model was evaluated using pathological tissue sections and biochemical indices such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Metabolomics analysis of plasma was performed using the UHPLC-QTOF/MS technique to screen for potential biomarkers and enriched metabolic pathways. The potential targets and pathways of MII were predicted by network pharmacology, and the mechanism was verified by Western blot analysis. MII significantly improved the pathological liver changes in mice with liver injury. The content of ALT and AST was decreased, and the activity of SOD was increased significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, 0.01).

The SLK cattle showed lower VT throughout the day and greater VSRE at 1000 h and 1100 h compared with their WT counterparts. Total mammary blood flow (MBF) was greater in SLK Holsteins compared with WT. The metabolite 9-nitrooctadecenoic acid was identified as a potential biomarker for MBF; moreover, SLK cattle had greater amounts of this metabolite in their plasma.

However, there are concerns about the reproducibility of untargeted metabolomics research due to the absence of uniform reporting practices, data analyses, and experimental design guidelines. Therefore, we critically evaluated published untargeted metabolomic platforms used to characterize IEMs to summarize the strengths and areas for improvement of this technology as it progresses towards the clinical laboratory. A total of 96 distinct IEMs were collectively evaluated by the included studies. However, most of these IEMs were evaluated by a single untargeted metabolomic method, in a single study, with a limited cohort size (55/96, 57%). The goals of the included studies generally fell into two, often overlapping, categories: detecting known biomarkers from many biochemically distinct IEMs using a single platform, and detecting novel metabolites or metabolic pathways. There was notable diversity in the design of the untargeted metabolomic platforms. Importantly, the majority of studies reported adherence to quality metrics, including the use of quality control samples and internal standards in their experiments, as well as confirmation of at least some of their feature annotations with commercial reference standards. Future applications of untargeted metabolomics platforms to the study of IEMs should move beyond single-subject analyses, and evaluate reproducibility using a prospective, or validation cohort.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to investigate the plasma metabolite profiles of T2DM patients with and without DCM. We identified significant differences in metabolite levels between the groups, highlighting the dysregulation of various metabolic pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. Although several metabolites showed altered abundance in DCM, they also shared characteristics of DCM and T2DM rather than specific to DCM. Additionally, through biomarker analyses, we identified potential biomarkers for DCM, such as cytidine triphosphate, 11-ketoetiocholanolone, saccharopine, nervonic acid, and erucic acid. These biomarkers demonstrated distinct patterns and associations with metabolic pathways related to DCM.

Lipid dysregulation after TBI is underexplored, and a better understanding of lipid turnover and degradation could point to novel biomarker candidates and therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated overlapping lipidome changes in the brain and blood using a data-driven discovery approach to understand lipid alterations in the brain and serum compartments acutely following mild TBI (mTBI) and the potential efflux of brain lipids to peripheral blood. The cortices and sera from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were analyzed via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) in both positive and negative ion modes following single and repetitive closed head impacts. The overlapping lipids in the data sets were identified with an in-house data dictionary for investigating lipid class changes. MS-based lipid profiling revealed overall increased changes in the serum compartment, while the brain lipids primarily showed decreased changes. Interestingly, there were prominent alterations in the sphingolipid class in the brain and blood compartments after single and repetitive injury, which may suggest efflux of brain sphingolipids into the blood after TBI. Genetic algorithms were used for predictive panel selection to classify injured and control samples with high sensitivity and specificity. These overlapping lipid panels primarily mapped to the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <i>q</i>-values less than 0.05.

Intensive captive breeding is essential for understanding the biology of critically endangered species, especially their pregnancy characteristics, knowledge of which is crucial for effective breeding management. Urine metabolomics can reveal metabolic differences, arising from physiological changes across pregnancy stages. Therefore, we used the urinary metabolomic technology, to explore urinary metabolite changes in pregnant Yangtze finless porpoises. A total of 2281 metabolites were identified in all samples, which including organic acids and derivatives (24.45%), organoheterocyclic compounds (20.23%), benzenoids (18.05%), organic oxygen compounds (7.73%), and phenylpropanoids and polyketides (6.48%).

The levels of pregnenolone, 17&#x3b1;-hydroxyprogesterone, and tetrahydrocortisone were significantly higher during all pregnancy stages, indicating their important roles in fetal development. The differential metabolites between nonpregnancy and pregnancy were mainly associated with amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, metabolic activity varied across pregnancy stages; steroid hormone biosynthesis was predominant in early pregnancy, and amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism were predominant in mid pregnancy and late pregnancy, respectively. Our results provide new insights into metabolic characteristics in the Yangtze finless porpoises' urine during pregnancy, and indicate that the differential levels of urine metabolites can determine pregnancy in Yangtze finless porpoises, providing valuable information for the husbandry and management of pregnant Yangtze finless porpoises in captivity.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Identifying an optimal strategy for preventing VCI and developing efficient symptomatic treatments remains a significant challenge. Syndrome differentiation represents a fundamental approach for personalized diagnosis and treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and aligns with the principles of precision medicine. The objective of this study was to elucidate the metabolic characteristics of VCI based on TCM syndrome differentiation, thus providing novel insights into the diagnosis and treatment of VCI. <b>Methods:</b> A 2-year cross-sectional cognitive survey was conducted in four communities in Beijing between September 2020 and November 2022. The syndrome differentiation of participants was based on the Kidney-Yang Deficiency Syndrome Scale (KYDSS), which was originally developed by Delphi expert consultation. The identification of serum metabolites was performed by Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) analysis coupled with an electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-QTOF MS). Multivariate, univariate, and pathway analyses were used to investigate metabolic changes. Logistic regression models were also used to construct metabolite panels that were capable of discerning distinct groups. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) levels were measured by a commercial ELISA kit. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,337 residents completed the survey, and the prevalence of VCI was 9.84%. Of the patients with VCI, those with Kidney-Yang deficiency syndrome (VCIS) accounted for 70.87% of cases and exhibited more severe cognitive impairments. A total of 80 participants were included in metabolomics study, including 30 with VCIS, 20 without Kidney-Yang deficiency syndrome (VCINS), and 30 healthy control participants (C). Ultimately, 45 differential metabolites were identified when comparing the VCIS group with group C, 65 differential metabolites between the VCINS group and group C, and 27 differential metabolites between the VCIS group and the VCINS group. The downregulation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) along with the upregulation of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidic acid (PA) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) can be considered as the general metabolic characteristics associated with VCI. Dysfunction of glycerophospholipids, particularly LPEs and PCs, was identified as a key metabolic characteristic of VCIS. In particular Glycerophospho-N-Arachidonoyl Ethanolamine (GP-NArE) was discovered for the first time in VCI patients and is considered to represent a potential biomarker for VCIS. The upregulation of PLA2 expression was implicated in the induction of alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism in both VCIS and VCINS. Moreover, robust diagnostic models were established based on these metabolites, achieving high AUC values of 0.9322, 0.9550, and 0.9450, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings contribute valuable information relating to the intricate relationship between metabolic disorders in VCI, neurodegeneration and vascular/neuroinflammation. Our findings also provide a TCM perspective for the precise diagnosis and treatment of VCI in the context of precision medicine.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

The potential biomarkers and related core metabolic pathways were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with linear ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometry(UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS) combined with principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA). MetaboAnalyst 5.0 was used to establish the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve for evaluating the clinical diagnostic performance of core metabolites. The results showed that acteoside significantly decreased urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio in PAN young rats. A total of 17 differential metabolites were screened out by non-targeted urine metabolomics in PAN young rats and they were involved in phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. Thirtten differential metabolites were screened by acteoside intervention in PAN young rats, and they were involved in phenylalanine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism. Among them, leucylproline and acetophenone were the differential metabolites that were significantly recovered after acteoside treatment. These pathways suggest that acteoside treats PAN in young rats by regulating amino acid metabolism. The area under the curve of two core biomarkers, leucylproline and acetophenone, were both greater than 0.9. In summary, acteoside may restore amino acid metabolism by regulating endogenous differential metabolites in PAN young rats, which will help to clarify the mechanism of acteoside in treating chronic glomerulonephritis in children.

The objective of this research was to develop an analytical method for halal authentication testing of beef meatballs (BM) from dog meat (DM) using a non-targeted metabolomics approach employing liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and chemometrics. The differentiation of authentic BM from that adulterated with DM was successfully performed using partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with high accuracy (R<sup>2</sup>X&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.980, and R<sup>2</sup>Y&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.980) and good predictivity (Q<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.517).

A number of metabolites, potential for biomarker candidates, were identified to differentiate BM and that adulterated with DM.

The developed method was successfully applied for analysis of commercial meatball samples (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;28). Moreover, pathway analysis revealed that beta-alanine, histidine, and ether lipid metabolism were significantly affected by dog meat adulteration.

These parameters are traditionally obtained through a liver biopsy. However, liver biopsy presents both invasiveness and potential sampling errors, primarily due to inadequate biopsy size. To circumvent these issues, several non-invasive markers have been proposed as alternatives for diagnosing liver damage.

Due to the asymptomatic features of HCC at early stages, patients are often diagnosed at advanced stages and missed effective treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify sensitive and specific biomarkers for HCC early diagnosis. In the present study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) approach was used to profile serum metabolites from HCC patients, liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and normal controls (NC). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to obtain the metabolomic differences of the three groups and select significantly changed metabolites that can be used as diagnostic biomarkers. In total, 757 differential metabolites were quantified among the three groups, and pathway enrichment analysis of these metabolites indicated that glycerophospholipid metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and linoleic acid metabolism were the most altered pathways involved in HCC development. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to select and evaluate the diagnostic biomarker performance. Seven metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers that can differentiate HCC from LC and NC, and LC from NC with the good diagnostic performance of area under the curve (AUC) from 0.890 to 0.990.

The crop quality and production is largely hampered due to the fungal pathogen Alternaria solani causing necrotrophic foliage early blight disease. Crop plants usually respond to the biotic challenges with altered metabolic composition and physiological perturbations. We have deciphered altered metabolite composition, modulated metabolic pathways and identified metabolite biomarkers in A. solani-challenged susceptible tomato variety Kashi Aman using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics. Alteration in the metabolite feature composition of pathogen-challenged (m/z 9405) and non-challenged (m/z 9667) plant leaves including 8487 infection-exclusive and 8742 non-infection exclusive features was observed. Functional annotation revealed putatively annotated metabolites and pathway mapping indicated their enrichment in metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ubiquinone and terpenoid-quinones, brassinosteroids, steroids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, carotenoids, oxy/sphingolipids and metabolism of biotin and porphyrin. PCA, multivariate PLS-DA and OPLS-DA analysis showed sample discrimination. Significantly up regulated 481 and down regulated 548 metabolite features were identified based on the fold change (threshold&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2.0).

Due to their diversity, it is a challenge to diagnose IMDs in time, effecting an emerging need for a comprehensive test to acquire an overview of metabolite status. Untargeted metabolomics has proven its clinical potential in diagnosing IMDs, but is not yet widely used in genetic metabolic laboratories. <b>Methods:</b> We assessed the potential role of plasma untargeted metabolomics in a clinical diagnostic setting by using direct infusion high resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) in parallel with traditional targeted metabolite assays. We compared quantitative data and qualitative performance of targeted versus untargeted metabolomics in patients suspected of an IMD (<i>n</i> = 793 samples) referred to our laboratory for 1&#xa0;year. To compare results of both approaches, the untargeted data was limited to polar metabolites that were analyzed in targeted plasma assays. These include amino acid, (acyl)carnitine and creatine metabolites and are suitable for diagnosing IMDs across many of the disease groups described in the international classification of inherited metabolic disorders (ICIMD). <b>Results:</b> For the majority of metabolites, the concentrations as measured in targeted assays correlated strongly with the semi quantitative Z-scores determined with DI-HRMS. For 64/793 patients, targeted assays showed an abnormal metabolite profile possibly indicative of an IMD. In 55 of these patients, similar aberrations were found with DI-HRMS. The remaining 9 patients showed only marginally increased or decreased metabolite concentrations that, in retrospect, were most likely to be clinically irrelevant. Illustrating its potential, DI-HRMS detected additional patients with aberrant metabolites that were indicative of an IMD not detected by targeted plasma analysis, such as purine and pyrimidine disorders and a carnitine synthesis disorder. <b>Conclusion:</b> This one-year pilot study showed that DI-HRMS untargeted metabolomics can be used as a first-tier approach replacing targeted assays of amino acid, acylcarnitine and creatine metabolites with ample opportunities to expand. Using DI-HRMS untargeted metabolomics as a first-tier will open up possibilities to look for new biomarkers.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Herein, we explore metabolic alterations due to mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) treatment of septic shock. The clinical findings for this study were already reported; MSC therapy was well-tolerated and safe in patients in this phase I clinical trial. In this exploratory metabolomics study, 9 out of 30 patients received an escalating dose of MSC treatment, while 21 patients were without MSC treatment. Serum metabolomics profiling was performed to detect and characterize metabolite changes due to MSC treatment and to help determine the sample size needed for a phase II clinical trial and to define a metabolomic response to MSC treatment. Serum metabolites were measured using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and HILIC-MS at times 0, 24 and 72 h after MSC infusion.

Not only does it provide information about normal physiological functions, it is even more of interest for biomarker discovery and target discovery in disease. The extracellular analysis of the brain is particularly interesting as it provides information about the release of mediators in the brain extracellular fluid to look at cellular signaling and metabolic pathways through the release, diffusion and re-uptake of neurochemicals. In vivo samples are obtained through microdialysis, cerebral open-flow microperfusion or solid-phase microextraction. The analytes of potential interest are typically low in concentration and can have a wide range of physicochemical properties. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has proven its usefulness in brain metabolomics. It allows sensitive and specific analysis of low sample volumes, obtained through different approaches. Several strategies for the analysis of the extracellular fluid have been proposed. The most widely used approaches apply sample derivatization, specific stationary phases and/or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Miniaturization of these methods allows an even higher sensitivity. The development of chiral metabolomics is indispensable, as it allows to compare the enantiomeric ratio of compounds and provides even more challenges. Some limitations continue to exist for the previously developed methods and the development of new, more sensitive methods remains needed.

The one-dimensional proton pulse sequences typically used in phenotyping large numbers of samples generate spectra that are rich in information but where metabolite identification is often compromised by peak overlap. Recently developed pure shift (PS) NMR spectroscopy, where all J-coupling multiplicities are removed from the spectra, has the potential to simplify the complex proton NMR spectra that arise from biosamples and hence to aid metabolite identification. Here we have evaluated two complementary approaches to spectral simplification: the HOBS (band-selective with real-time acquisition) and the PSYCHE (broadband with pseudo-2D interferogram acquisition) pulse sequences. We compare their relative sensitivities and robustness for deconvolving both urine and serum matrices. Both methods improve resolution of resonances ranging from doublets, triplets and quartets to more complex signals such as doublets of doublets and multiplets in highly overcrowded spectral regions. HOBS is the more sensitive method and takes less time to acquire in comparison with PSYCHE, but can introduce unavoidable artefacts from metabolites with strong couplings, whereas PSYCHE is more adaptable to these types of spin system, although at the expense of sensitivity. Both methods are robust and easy to implement. We also demonstrate that strong coupling artefacts contain latent connectivity information that can be used to enhance metabolite identification. Metabolite identification is a bottleneck in metabolic profiling studies. In the case of NMR, PS experiments can be included in metabolite identification workflows, providing additional capability for biomarker discovery.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

Careful monitoring of voriconazole-associated hepatotoxicity is needed but there are no specific plasma biomarkers for this condition. Metabolomics has emerged as a promising technique for investigating biomarkers associated with drug-induced toxicity. The aim of this study was to use targeted metabolomics to evaluate seven endogenous metabolites as potential biomarkers of voriconazole-associated hepatotoxicity. Patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole were classified into a hepatotoxicity group (18 patients) or a control group (153 patients). Plasma samples were analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Metabolite concentrations in the two groups were compared. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves generated from logistic regressions were used to correlate the concentrations of these seven metabolites with voriconazole trough concentrations and conventional liver biochemistry tests. Glycocholate and &#x3b1;-ketoglutarate levels were significantly higher in the hepatotoxicity group compared with the control group (false discovery rate-corrected P &lt; 0.001 and P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.024, respectively).

Salinity stress is one of the important environmental stresses that severely affects rice productivity. Although, several vital physio-biochemical and molecular responses have been activated in rice under salinity stress which were well described in literatures, the mechanistic role of salt stress and microbes-induced metabolites to overcome salt stress in rice are less studied. Nevertheless, over the years, metabolomic studies have allowed a comprehensive analyses of rice salt stress responses. Hence, we review the salt stress-triggered alterations of various metabolites in rice and discuss their significant roles toward salinity tolerance. Some of the metabolites such as serotonin, salicylic acid, ferulic acid and gentisic acid may act as signaling molecules to activate different downstream salt-tolerance mechanisms; whereas, the other compounds such as amino acids, sugars and organic acids directly act as protective agents to maintain osmotic balance and scavenger of reactive oxygen species during the salinity stress. The quantity, type, tissues specificity and time of accumulation of metabolites induced by salinity stress vary between salt-sensitive and tolerant rice genotypes and thus, contribute to their different degrees of salt tolerance. Moreover, few tolerance metabolites such as allantoin, serotonin and melatonin induce unique pathways for activation of defence mechanisms in salt-tolerant varieties of rice, suggesting their potential roles as the universal biomarkers for salt tolerance. Therefore, these metabolites can be applied exogenously to the sensitive genotypes of rice to enhance their performance under salt stress. Furthermore, the microbes of rhizosphere also participated in rice salt tolerance either directly or indirectly by regulating their metabolic pathways. Thus, this review for the first time offers valuable and comprehensive insights into salt-induced spatio-temporal and genotype-specific metabolites in different genotypes of rice which provide a reference point to analyze stress-gene-metabolite relationships for the biomarker designing in rice. Further, it can also help to decipher several metabolic systems associated with salt tolerance in rice which will be useful in developing salt-tolerance cultivars by conventional breeding/genetic engineering/exogenous application of metabolites.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

However, following enzyme assay-coupled protein fractionation and subsequent proteomics analysis, we identify aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) as the predominant contributor to erythrose oxidation to erythronate in cell extracts. Through modulating ALDH1A1 expression in cancer cell lines, we provide additional support. We hence describe a possible alternative route to erythronate production involving the dephosphorylation of E4P to form erythrose, followed by its oxidation by ALDH1A1. Finally, we measure increased erythronate concentrations in tumors relative to adjacent normal tissues from lung cancer patients. These findings suggest the accumulation of erythronate to be an example of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, raising the possibility that elevated levels of erythronate may serve as a biomarker of certain types of cancer.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Using metabolomics and lipidomics approaches, this study aims to identify serum biomarkers for identification of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC).

The uncertainty of the etiology of the disease and its complexity along with nonspecific symptoms have led to misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis of affected people. Biopsy and laparoscopy are referred to as the gold standard for endometriosis diagnosis. However, the invasiveness of the procedure, the unnecessary operation in disease-free women, and the dependence of the reliability of diagnosis on experience in this area are considered the most significant limitations. Therefore, continuous studies have attempted to offer a noninvasive and reliable approach.

Statins inhibit endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, which reduces LDL-c plasma levels and prevent from cardiovascular events. This study aimed to explore the effects of statin treatment on serum lipidomic profile and to identify biomarkers of response in subjects with FH. Seventeen adult FH patients underwent a 6-week washout followed by 4-week treatment with atorvastatin (80&#xa0;mg/day) or rosuvastatin (40&#xa0;mg/day). LDL-c response was considered good (40-70 % reduction, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;9) or poor (3-33 % reduction, n&#xa0;=&#xa0;8). Serum lipidomic profile was analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and data were analyzed using MetaboAnalyst v5.0. Lipidomic analysis identified 353 lipids grouped into 16 classes. Statin treatment reduced drastically 8 of 13 lipid classes, generating a characteristic lipidomic profile with a significant contribution of phosphatidylinositols (PI) 16:0/18:2, 18:0/18:1 and 18:0/18:2; and triacylglycerols (TAG) 18:2x2/18:3, 18:1/18:2/18:3, 16:1/18:2x2, 16:1/18:2/18:3 and 16:1/18:2/Arachidonic acid (p-adjusted &lt;0.05).

Metabolomic profiles have served as a vital biomarker for the early identification of high-risk individuals and disease prevention. However, current approaches can only characterize individual key metabolites, without taking into account the reality that complex diseases are multifactorial, dynamic, heterogeneous, and interdependent. Here, we leverage a statistical physics model to combine all metabolites into bidirectional, signed, and weighted interaction networks and trace how the flow of information from one metabolite to the next causes changes in health state. Viewing a disease outcome as the consequence of complex interactions among its interconnected components (metabolites), we integrate concepts from ecosystem theory and evolutionary game theory to model how the health state-dependent alteration of a metabolite is shaped by its intrinsic properties and through extrinsic influences from its conspecifics. We code intrinsic contributions as nodes and extrinsic contributions as edges into quantitative networks and implement GLMY homology theory to analyze and interpret the topological change of health state from symbiosis to dysbiosis and vice versa. The application of this model to real data allows us to identify several hub metabolites and their interaction webs, which play a part in the formation of inflammatory bowel diseases. The findings by our model could provide important information on drug design to treat these diseases and beyond.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

An analysis of the metabolomes of cancer samples and para-carcinoma tissues was conducted. We identified a series of important metabolic changes in colon cancer by analyzing metabolites in cancerous tissues compared to their normal counterparts. They are mainly involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA cycle, glycolysis, galactose metabolism, and butanoate metabolism. As well, we observed dysregulation of AMP, dTMP, fructose, and D-glucose in colon cancer. Additionally, the AUCs for AMP, dTMP, fructose, and D-glucose were greater than 0.7 for the diagnosis of colon cancer. In conclusion, AMP, dTMP, fructose, and D-glucose showed excellent diagnostic performance and could serve as novel disease biomarkers for colon cancer diagnosis.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

The pathological features of lung tissue showed that CLDS-i caused congestion and inflammation in the lungs, and the lung structure was severely damaged. Metabolomics analysis showed that 141 metabolites were significantly changed in the lung tissue of the CLDS-i group compared with the control group. Combined with Kegg pathway analysis, it was found that the changes of amino acid metabolites were involved in these pathways, indicating that the simulated lunar dust exposure had the most obvious effect on amino acid metabolism in the lung tissue of rats. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression of six key enzymes related to amino acid metabolism was changed, and the enzyme activities of these key enzymes were also changed, which were consistent with the results of qPCR. These results suggest that changes in amino acid metabolism may be closely related to the pathogenesis of lung injury induced by lunar dust, and amino acid metabolism may be a potential biomarker of lung diseases related to lunar dust exposure.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2024}

As part of a multi-year study to investigate causes of reoccurring mortality of pheasantshell (<i>Ortmanniana pectorosa;</i> synonym <i>Actinonaias pectorosa</i>) in the Clinch River, Virginia and Tennessee, USA, we analyzed the hemolymph metabolome of a subset of mussels from the 2018 sampling period. Mussels at the mortality sites were diagnosed in the field as affected (case) or unaffected (control) based on behavioral and physical signs. Hemolymph was collected in the field by non-lethal methods from the anterior adductor muscle for analysis. We used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy to detect targeted and untargeted metabolites in hemolymph and compared metabolomic profiles by field assessment of clinical status. Targeted biomarker analysis found 13 metabolites associated with field assessments of clinical status. Of these, increased gamma-linolenic acid and <i>N</i>-methyl-l-alanine were most indicative of case mussels, while adenine and inosine were the best indicators of control mussels. Five pathways in the targeted analysis differed by clinical status; two of these, purine metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, were also indicated in the untargeted analysis. In the untargeted nalysis, 22 metabolic pathways were associated with clinical status. Many of the impacted pathways in the case group were catabolic processes, such as degradation of amino acids and fatty acids. Hierarchical clustering analysis matched clinical status in 72% (18 of 25) of mussels, with control mussels more frequently (5 of 16) not matching clinical status. Our study demonstrated that metabolomic analysis of hemolymph is suitable for assessing mussel condition and complements field-based indicators of health.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

The study aims to identify biomarkers of broccoli intake using metabolomic approaches, examine the dose-response relationship, and predict the intake by multimarker panel. Eighteen volunteers consumed cooked broccoli in A-Diet Discovery study and fasting and postprandial urine samples were collected at 2, 4 and 24 hours. Subsequently the A-Diet Dose-response study was performed where volunteers consumed different portions of broccoli (49, 101 or 153 g) and urine samples were collected at the end of each intervention week. Urine samples were analysed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and LC-MS. Multivariate data analysis and one-way ANOVA were performed to identify discriminating biomarkers. A panel of putative biomarkers was examined for its ability to predict intake through a multiMarker model. Multivariate analysis revealed discriminatory spectral regions between fasting and fed metabolic profiles. Subsequent time-series plots revealed multiple features increased in concentration following the consumption. Urinary <i>S</i>-methyl cysteine sulfoxide (SMCSO) increased as broccoli intake increased (0.17-0.24 &#x3bc;M per mOSM per kg, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

It is of great significance to describe the metabolic characteristics of VOR - induced liver injury and to elucidate the potential mechanisms. This study investigated the changes of plasma metabolic profiles in a rat model of VOR - induced liver injury by non - targeted metabolomics. Correlation analysis was performed between differentially expressed metabolites and plasma liver function indexes. The metabolites with strong correlation were determined for their predictive performance for liver injury using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Potential biomarkers were then screened combined with liver pathological scores. Finally, the expression level of genes that involved in lipid metabolism were determined in rat liver to verify the mechanism of VOR - induced liver injury we proposed. VOR - induced liver injury in rats was characterized by plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, the lipid droplets accumulation in liver, as well as inflammation and fibrosis. Significant changes of plasma metabolites were observed, with a decrease in lipid metabolites accounting for over 50% of all changed metabolites, and alterations of cholesterol and bile acids metabolites. The decrease of 3 phosphatidylcholine (PC) in plasma could indicate the occurrence of VOR - induced liver injury. Decreased fatty acids (FA) oxidation and bile acid excretion might be the potential mechanisms of VOR - induced liver injury.

In this study, we investigated the associations between nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics biomarkers and aging-related diseases as well as mortality using the UK Biobank dataset. We analyzed NMR samples from approximately 110,000 participants and used multi-head machine learning classification models to predict the incidence of aging-related diseases. Cox regression models were then applied to assess the relevance of NMR biomarkers to the risk of death due to aging-related diseases. Additionally, we conducted survival analyses to evaluate the potential improvements of NMR in predicting survival and identify the biomarkers most strongly associated with negative health outcomes by dividing participants into health, disease, and death groups for all age groups. Our analysis revealed specific metabolomics profiles that were associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, and the most significant biomarker was intermediate density lipoprotein cholesteryl (IDL-CE).

C57BL/6 male mice were intranasally infected with PR8 virus at 50 or 500 plaque-forming units to cause sublethal or lethal influenza, respectively.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), as a gold standard for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, fails to cover all the cytopathologic conditions resulting in overdiagnosis. There is an urgent need for a better classification of thyroid cancer from benign thyroid nodules (BTNs). Here, data independent acquisition (DIA)-based proteomics and untargeted metabolomics in plasma samples of 10 patients with TC and 15 patients with BTNs were performed. Key proteins and metabolites were identified specific to TC, and an independent cohort was used to validate the potential biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In total, 1429 proteins and 1172 metabolites were identified. Principal component analysis showed a strong overlap at the proteomic level and a significant discrimination at the metabolomic level between the two groups, indicating a more drastic disturbance in the metabolome of thyroid cancer. Integrated analysis of proteomics and metabolomics shows glycerophospholipid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism as key regulatory pathways.

However, for economic purposes, BS is often adulterated with pork by unethical players. Pork consumption is strictly prohibited for religions including Islam and Judaism. Therefore, advanced detection methods are highly required to warrant the halal authenticity of BS. This research aimed to develop a liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method to determine the halal authenticity of BS using an untargeted metabolomics approach. LC-HRMS was capable of detecting various metabolites in BS and BS containing pork. The presence of pork in BS could be differentiated using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with high accuracy. PLS-DA perfectly classified authentic BS and BS containing pork in all concentration levels of pork with R<sup>2</sup>X = (0.821), R<sup>2</sup>Y(= 0.984), and Q<sup>2</sup> = (0.795). The level of pork in BS was successfully predicted through partial least squares (PLS) and orthogonal PLS (OPLS) chemometrics. Both models gave high R<sup>2</sup> (&gt;0.99) actual and predicted values as well as few errors, indicating good accuracy and precision. Identification of discriminating metabolites' potential as biomarker candidates through variable importance for projections (VIP) value revealed metabolites of 2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 3-hydroxyoctanoylcarnitine, 8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid, D-(+)-galactose, oleamide, 3-hydroxyhexadecanoylcarnitine, arachidonic acid, and &#x3b1;-eleostearic acid as good indicators to detect pork. It can be concluded that LC-HRMS metabolomics combined with PCA, PLS-DA, PLS, and OPLS was successfully used to detect pork adulteration in beef sausages.

Data acquisition was conducted across 1.2 years, including seven column changes. In total, 413 pooled QC (training) and 413 BioIVT samples (validation) were used for normalization comparisons. Surprisingly, neither internal standards nor sum-based normalizations yielded median precision of less than 30% across all 563 metabolite annotations. While the machine-learning-based SERRF algorithm gave 19% median precision based on the pooled quality control samples, external cross-validation with BioIVT plasma pools yielded a median 34% relative standard deviation (RSD). We developed a new method: systematic error reduction by denoising autoencoder (SERDA). SERDA lowered the median standard deviations of the training QC samples down to 16% RSD, yielding an overall error of 19% RSD when applied to the independent BioIVT validation QC samples. This is the largest study on GC-MS metabolomics ever reported, demonstrating that technical errors can be normalized and handled effectively for this assay.

Secondly, precision nutrition allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of how diet influences disease risk and identify individuals who are more susceptible to disease due to gene-diet or microbiota-diet interactions. Third, precision nutrition can be used for 'personalised nutrition' advice where machine-learning algorithms can integrate data from omic profiles with other personal and clinical measures to improve disease risk. Proteomics and metabolomics especially provide the ability to discover new biomarkers of food or nutrient intake, proteomic or metabolomic signatures of diet and disease, and discover potential mechanisms of diet-disease interactions. Although there are several challenges that must be overcome to improve the reproducibility, cost-effectiveness and efficacy of these approaches, precision nutrition methodologies have great potential for nutrition research and clinical application.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Early diagnosis through lipidomic profiling can improve prognostic outcomes. In this study, a uniform PbS/Au-layered substrate that enhances the laser desorption/ionization process, an interfacial process triggered on the substrate surface upon laser excitation, was designed to efficiently characterize the lipidomic profiles of LC patient serum. By controlling the stacking arrangement and particle sizes of PbS QDs and AuNPs, the optimized substrate promotes the generation of excited electrons and creates an enhanced electric field that polarizes analyte molecules, facilitating ion adduction formation ([M + Na]<sup>+</sup> and [M + K]<sup>+</sup>) and enhancing detection sensitivity down to the femtomole level. Combining multivariate statistics and machine learning, a distinct lipidomic biomarker panel is successfully identified for the early diagnosis and staging of LC, with an accurate prediction validated by an area under the curve of 0.9479 and 0.9034, respectively. We also found that 18 biomarkers were significantly correlated with six metabolic pathways associated with LC. These results demonstrate the potential of this innovative PbS/Au-layered substrate as a sensitive platform for accurate diagnosis of LC and facilitate the development of lipidomic-based diagnostic tools for other cancers.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

A more detailed understanding of its pathophysiology, beyond the accumulation of GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), will increase our understanding of the disease and may support novel therapy development. To this end, we compared biochemical body fluid profiles from SSADHD patients with controls using next-generation metabolic screening (NGMS). Targeted analysis of NGMS data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a moderate increase of aspartic acid, glutaric acid, glycolic acid, 4-guanidinobutanoic acid, and 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, and prominent elevations of GHB and 4,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid (4,5-DHHA) in SSADHD samples. Remarkably, the intensities of 4,5-DHHA and GHB showed a significant positive correlation in control CSF, but not in patient CSF. In an established zebrafish epilepsy model, 4,5-DHHA showed increased mobility that may reflect limited epileptogenesis. Using untargeted metabolomics, we identified 12 features in CSF with high biomarker potential. These had comparable increased fold changes as GHB and 4,5-DHHA. For 10 of these features, a similar increase was found in plasma, urine and/or mouse brain tissue for SSADHD compared to controls. One of these was identified as the novel biomarker 4,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid. The intensities of selected features in plasma and urine of SSADHD patients positively correlated with the clinical severity score of epilepsy and psychiatric symptoms of those patients, and also showed a high mutual correlation.

Antibiotics are critical for the initial treatment of bacterial infections. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics results in the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and the discovery and development of new antibiotics are declining. Therefore, understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms and developing novel control measures are essential. In the present study, GC-MS-based metabolomics analysis was performed to determine the metabolic profile of gentamicin sensitive (SE-S) and resistant (SE-R) S. enterica. Fructose was identified as a crucial biomarker. Further analysis demonstrated a global depressed central carbon metabolism and energy metabolism in SE-R. The decrease in the pyruvate cycle reduces the production of NADH and ATP, causing a decrease in membrane potential, which contributes to gentamicin resistance. Exogenous fructose potentiated the effectiveness of gentamicin in killing SE-R by promoting the pyruvate cycle, NADH, ATP and membrane potential, thereby increasing gentamicin intake. Further, fructose plus gentamicin improved the survival rate of chicken infected with gentamicin-resistant Salmonella in vivo. Given that metabolite structures are conserved across species, fructose identified from bacteria could be used as a biomarker for breeding disease-resistant phenotypes in chicken. Therefore, a novel strategy is proposed for fighting against antibiotic-resistant S. enterica, including exploring molecules suppressed by antibiotics and providing a new approach to find pathogen targets for disease resistance in chicken breeding.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Since there are a few treatments of plasma/serum samples for quantitative analysis without a universally accepted method, this topic remains of interest for future research. <b>Methods:</b> In this work, targeted metabolomic profiling of 43 metabolites was performed on pooled plasma to compare four methodologies consisting of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) editing, ultrafiltration, protein precipitation with methanol, and glycerophospholipid solid-phase extraction (g-SPE) for phospholipid removal; prior to NMR metabolomics analysis. The effect of the sample treatments on the metabolite concentrations was evaluated using a permutation test of multiclass and pairwise Fisher scores. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that methanol precipitation and ultrafiltration had a higher number of metabolites with coefficient of variation (CV) values above 20%.

For example, pairwise comparisons showed that methanol precipitation and CPMG editing were suitable for quantifying citrate, while g-SPE showed better results for 2-hydroxybutyrate and tryptophan. <b>Discussion:</b> There are alterations in the absolute concentration of various metabolites that are dependent on the procedure. Considering these alterations is essential before proceeding with the quantification of treatment-sensitive metabolites in biological samples for improving biomarker discovery and biological interpretations. The study demonstrated that g-SPE and CPMG editing are effective methods for removing proteins and phospholipids from plasma samples for quantitative NMR analysis of metabolites. However, careful consideration should be given to the specific metabolites of interest and their susceptibility to the sample treatment procedures. These findings contribute to the development of optimized sample preparation protocols for metabolomics studies using NMR spectroscopy.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

A framework called Multiple-Chemical nebula (MCnebula) was developed herein to facilitate the LC-MS data analysis process by focusing on critical chemical classes and visualization in multiple dimensions. This framework consists of three vital steps as follows: (1) abundance-based classes (ABC) selection algorithm, (2) critical chemical classes to classify \"features\" (corresponding to compounds), and (3) visualization as multiple Child-Nebulae (network graph) with annotation, chemical classification, and structure. Notably, MCnebula can be used to explore the classification and structural characteristic of unknown compounds beyond the limit of the spectral library. Moreover, it is intuitive and convenient for pathway analysis and biomarker discovery because of its function of ABC selection and visualization. MCnebula was implemented in the R language. A series of tools in R packages were provided to facilitate downstream analysis in an MCnebula-featured way, including feature selection, homology tracing of top features, pathway enrichment analysis, heat map clustering analysis, spectral visualization analysis, chemical information query, and output analysis reports. The broad utility of MCnebula was illustrated by a human-derived serum data set for metabolomics analysis.

The results showed that 100 mg/kg/day of GLPP administration significantly alleviated CTX-induced immune damage by improving immune organ indexes, earlap swelling rate, the index of carbon phagocytosis and clearance value, secretion of cytokines (TNF-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b3;, and IL-2), and immunoglobulin A(IgA) in the mice.

MCADD is clinically diagnosed using Newborn Bloodspot Screening (NBS) and genetic testing. Still, these methods have limitations, such as false negatives or positives in NBS and the variants of uncertain significance in genetic testing. Thus, complementary diagnostic approaches for MCADD are needed. Recently, untargeted metabolomics has been proposed as a diagnostic approach for inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) due to its ability to detect a wide range of metabolic alterations. We performed an untargeted metabolic profiling of dried blood spots (DBS) from MCADD newborns (<i>n</i> = 14) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 14) to discover potential metabolic biomarkers/pathways associated with MCADD. Extracted metabolites from DBS samples were analyzed using UPLC-QToF-MS for untargeted metabolomics analyses. Multivariate and univariate analyses were used to analyze the metabolomics data, and pathway and biomarker analyses were also performed on the significantly identified endogenous metabolites. The MCADD newborns had 1034 significantly dysregulated metabolites compared to healthy newborns (moderated <i>t</i>-test, no correction, <i>p</i>-value &#x2264; 0.05, FC 1.5). A total of 23 endogenous metabolites were up-regulated, while 84 endogenous metabolites were down-regulated.

Potential metabolic biomarkers for MCADD were PGP (a21:0/PG/F1alpha) and glutathione, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.949 and 0.898, respectively. PGP (a21:0/PG/F1alpha) was the first oxidized lipid in the top 15 biomarker list affected by MCADD. Additionally, glutathione was chosen to indicate oxidative stress events that could happen during fatty acid oxidation defects. Our findings suggest that MCADD newborns may have oxidative stress events as signs of the disease. However, further validations of these biomarkers are needed in future studies to ensure their accuracy and reliability as complementary markers with established MCADD markers for clinical diagnosis.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Biofilms exhibit unique metabolic patterns that set them apart from their planktonic counterparts, resulting in significant metabolic reprogramming during biofilm formation. Differential glycolytic enzymes suggest that central metabolic processes are markedly different in biofilms and planktonic cells. The glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is highly expressed in Staphylococcus aureus biofilm progenitors, indicating that changes in glycolysis activity play a role in biofilm development. Notably, an important consideration is a correlation between elevated cyclic di-guanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) activity and biofilm formation in various bacteria. C-di-GMP plays a critical role in maintaining the persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by regulating alginate production, a significant biofilm matrix component. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that S. aureus biofilm development is initiated by several tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates in a FnbA-dependent manner. Finally, Glucose 6-phosphatase (G6P) boosts the phosphorylation of histidine-containing protein (HPr) by increasing the activity of HPr kinase, enhancing its interaction with CcpA, and resulting in biofilm development through polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA) accumulation and icaADBC transcription. Therefore, studying the metabolic changes associated with biofilm development is crucial for understanding the complex mechanisms involved in biofilm formation and identifying potential targets for intervention. Accordingly, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in metabolomic profiling of biofilms, including emerging trends, prevailing challenges, and the identification of potential targets for anti-biofilm strategies.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

The samples were discriminated not only by the presence/absence of specific metabolites as distinguished markers of infection, but also on the basis of their relative abundance as important concluding factors. Annotation of metabolite features using the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (KEGG) database revealed 3371 compounds with KEGG identifiers belonging to biosynthetic pathways including secondary metabolites, cofactors, steroids, brassinosteroids, terpernoids, and fatty acids. Annotation using the <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> database in PLANTCYC PMN revealed significantly upregulated (541) and downregulated (485) features distributed in metabolite classes that appeared to play a crucial role in defense, infection prevention, signaling, plant growth, and plant homeostasis to survive under stress conditions. The orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), comprising a significant fold change (&#x2265;2.0) with VIP score (&#x2265;1.0), showed 34 upregulated biomarker metabolites including 5-phosphoribosylamine, kaur-16-en-18-oic acid, pantothenate, and <i>O</i>-acetyl-L-homoserine, along with 41 downregulated biomarkers. Downregulated metabolite biomarkers were mapped with pathways specifically known for plant defense, suggesting their prominent role in pathogen resistance. These results hold promise for identifying key biomarker metabolites that contribute to disease resistive metabolic traits/biosynthetic routes. This approach can assist in mQTL development for the stress breeding program in tomato against pathogen interactions.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

No biomarkers that can be used for effective monitoring of therapeutic interventions for this cancer have been identified to date. This study investigated polar metabolite profiles in urine samples from 100 BC patients and 100 normal controls (NCs) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and two methods of high-resolution nanoparticle-based laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS). Five urine metabolites were identified and quantified using NMR spectroscopy to be potential indicators of bladder cancer. Twenty-five LDI-MS-detected compounds, predominantly peptides and lipids, distinguished urine samples from BC and NCs individuals. Level changes of three characteristic urine metabolites enabled BC tumor grades to be distinguished, and ten metabolites were reported to correlate with tumor stages. Receiver-Operating Characteristics analysis showed high predictive power for all three types of metabolomics data, with the area under the curve (AUC) values greater than 0.87.

However, the complexity of IMS data hinders the further acquisition of biomarkers and the study of certain specific activities of organisms. To this end, we introduce an artificial intelligence tool, SmartGate, to enable automatic peak selection and spatial structure identification in an iterative manner. SmartGate selects discriminative m/z features from the previous iteration by differential analysis and employs a graph attention autoencoder model to perform spatial clustering for tissue segmentation using the selected features. We applied SmartGate to diverse IMS data at multicellular or subcellular spatial resolutions and compared it with four competing methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. SmartGate can significantly improve the accuracy of spatial segmentation and identify biomarker metabolites based on tissue structure-guided differential analysis.

The rising epidemic of diabetes and its complications, such as retinal and peripheral nerve disease, is a huge burden globally. A better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. High diabetes mellitus incidence rate is caused mainly by lack of non-invasive and reliable methods for early diagnosis, such as plasma biomarkers. The incidence of diabetes and its complications in the world still grows so it is crucial to develop a new, faster, high specificity and more sensitive diagnostic technologies. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can identify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner, and effective biomarkers can greatly improve the efficiency of diabetes and its complications. By providing information on potential metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further define the mechanisms underlying the progression of diabetes and its complications, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the prevention and management of T2D and its complications. The application of amino acid metabolomics in epidemiological studies has identified new biomarkers of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications, such as branched-chain amino acids, phenylalanine and arginine metabolites. This study focused on the analysis of metabolic amino acid profiling as a method for identifying biomarkers for the detection and screening of diabetes and its complications. The results presented are all from recent studies, and in all cases analyzed, there were significant changes in the amino acid profile of patients in the experimental group compared to the control group.

However, despite the success of active compounds derived from herbal medicine in drug discovery, some approaches cannot effectively elucidate the overall effect and action mechanism due to their multi-component complexity. Fortunately, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has been recognized as an effective strategy for revealing the effect and discovering active components, detailed molecular mechanisms, and multiple targets of natural products. Rapid identification of lead compounds and isolation of active components from natural products would facilitate new drug development. In this context, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has established an integrated pharmacology framework for the discovery of bioactivity-correlated constituents, target identification, and the action mechanism of herbal medicine and natural products. High-throughput functional metabolomics techniques could be used to identify natural product structure, biological activity, efficacy mechanisms, and their mode of action on biological processes, assisting bioactive lead discovery, quality control, and accelerating discovery of novel drugs. These techniques are increasingly being developed in the era of big data and use scientific language to clarify the detailed action mechanism of herbal medicine. In this paper, the analytical characteristics and application fields of several commonly used mass spectrometers are introduced, and the application of mass spectrometry in the metabolomics of traditional Chinese medicines in recent years and its active components as well as mechanism of action are also discussed.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Global analysis of dipeptides (400 common dipeptides in total number) in samples of complex matrices would enable functional studies of dipeptides and biomarker discovery. In this work, we report a method for high-coverage detection and accurate relative quantification of dipeptides. This method is based on differential chemical isotope labeling (CIL) of dipeptides with dansylation and liquid chromatography Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap-MS). An optimized LC gradient ensured the separation of dansyl-dipeptides, including positional isomers (e.g., leucine- and isoleucine-containing dipeptides). MS/MS collision energy in Orbitrap MS was optimized to provide characteristic fragment ion information to sequence dansyl-dipeptides. Using the optimized conditions, a CIL standard library consisting of retention time, MS, and MS/MS information of a whole set of 400 dansyl-dipeptides was constructed to facilitate rapid dipeptide identification. For qualitative analysis of dipeptides in real samples, IsoMS data processing software's parameters were tuned to improve the coverage of dipeptide annotation. Data-dependent acquisition was also carried out to improve the reliability of dipeptide identification. As examples of applications, we successfully identified a total of 321 dipeptides in rice wines and 105 dipeptides in human serum samples. For quantitative analysis, we demonstrated that the intensity ratios of the peak pairs from 96% of the dansyl-dipeptides detectable in a 1:1 mixture of <sup>12</sup>C- and <sup>13</sup>C-labeled rice wine samples were within &#xb1;20% of an expected value of 1.0.

It is urgent to find one new precise prevention and control therapy. The dynamically changing biomarkers during the development of pediatric pneumonia could help diagnose this disease, determine its severity, assess the risk of future events, and guide its treatment. Dexamethasone has been recognized as an effective agent with anti-inflammatory activity. However, its mechanisms against pediatric pneumonia remain unclear. In this study, spatial metabolomics was used to reveal the potential and characteristics of dexamethasone. Specifically, bioinformatics was first applied to find the critical biomarkers of differential expression in pediatric pneumonia. Subsequently, Desorption Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry imaging-based metabolomics screened the differential metabolites affected by dexamethasone. Then, a gene-metabolite interaction network was built to mark functional correlation pathways for exploring integrated information and core biomarkers related to the pathogenesis and etiology of pediatric pneumonia. Further, these were validated by molecular biology and targeted metabolomics. As a result, genes of Cluster of Differentiation19, Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb, Cluster of Differentiation 22, B-cell linker, Cluster of Differentiation 79B and metabolites of Triethanolamine, Lysophosphatidylcholine(18:1(9Z)), Phosphatidylcholine(16:0/16:0), phosphatidylethanolamine(O-18:1(1Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) were identified as the critical biomarkers in pediatric pneumonia.

Only 66% of discriminatory chemicals discovered in the DDA strategy were discriminatory features in the full scan dataset. Moreover, compared to the deconvoluted MS/MS spectra with coeluted and background ions from the AIF method, the MS/MS spectrum obtained from the targeted MS/MS approach is cleaner and purer.

Rhubarb anthraquinone was administered intragastric to rats at doses of 3.9, 7.8 and 15.6&#xa0;mg/kg, respectively, for 7&#xa0;days, and then 30% CCl<sub>4</sub> was injected intraperitoneally at the dose of 1&#xa0;ml/kg to replicate the acute liver injury model. The biochemical indicators content of ALT, AST, ALP, &#x3b3;-GT, TG, TC, LDL, HDL in serum and GSH, Hyp, SOD, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6 and IL-8 in liver tissue extract were tested respectively, and liver tissue was histopathologically analysis. At the same time, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS combined with non-targeted metabolomics were used to study the metabolites and metabolic pathways of rhubarb anthraquinone in treating acute liver injury. Compared with normal rats, the contents of ALT, AST, ALP, TG, TC, LDL, &#x3b3;-GT in serum and Hyp, MDA, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#x3b1; in the liver tissue extract were significantly increased in model rats (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and the content of HDL in the serum was significantly decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05); the activities of GSH and SOD in liver tissue extract were also significantly decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). After administration of rhubarb anthraquinone, compared with the model group, with the increase of dosage, some biochemical indexes showed opposite changes, and gradually approached to normal rats. 12 different metabolites were identified by metabonomics, and the biosynthesis and metabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, the metabolism of amino sugars, nucleotide sugars and pyrimidines metabolism, and the biosynthesis of steroid hormone were identified based on the biomarker analysis. Based on the biochemical analysis and metabonomics analysis of rats with acute liver injury treated with different doses of rhubarb anthraquinone, combined with histopathological observation, the results show that the protective effect of rhubarb anthraquinone on acute liver injury is related to the dosage; Meanwhile, the metabolic pathway analysis suggested that rhubarb anthraquinone alleviate acute liver injury by regulating inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis disorders. This study explained the therapeutic effect of rhubarb anthraquinone on acute liver injury from both material basis and action pathway, and provided safe and effective research ideas for clinical application of rhubarb.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

In contrast to the binary problem, the multiclass classification problem is more difficult in terms of obtaining reliable and stable results due to the increase in the complexity of determining exact class decision boundaries. In particular, methods of biomarker discovery and classification have a significant effect on the multiclass model because different methods with significantly varied theories produce conflicting results even for the same dataset. However, a systematic assessment for selecting the most appropriate methods of biomarker discovery and classification for multiclass metabolomics is still lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment is essential to measure the suitability of methods in multiclass classification models from multiple perspectives. In this study, five biomarker discovery methods and nine classification methods were assessed based on four benchmark datasets of multiclass metabolomics. The performance assessment of the biomarker discovery and classification methods was performed using three evaluation criteria: assessment <b><i>a</i></b> (cluster analysis of sample grouping), assessment <b><i>b</i></b> (biomarker consistency in multiple subgroups), and assessment <b><i>c</i></b> (accuracy in the classification model). As a result, 13 combining strategies with superior performance were selected under multiple criteria based on these benchmark datasets. In conclusion, superior strategies that performed consistently well are suggested for the discovery of biomarkers and the construction of a classification model for multiclass metabolomics.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Meat sector is largely involved in this ecological transition with the introduction of new label claims concerning the defense of animal welfare (AW). These new guarantees referred to AW provision require new tools for the purpose of authenticity and traceability to assure meat supply chain integrity. Over the years, European Union (EU) Regulations, national, and international initiatives proposed provisions and guidelines for assuring AW introducing requirements to be complied with and providing tools based on scoring systems for a proper animal <i>status</i> assessment. However, the comprehensive and objective assessment of the AW <i>status</i> remains challenging. In this regard, phenotypic insights at molecular level may be investigated by metabolomics, one of the most recent high-throughput omics techniques. Recent advances in analytical and bioinformatic technologies have led to the identification of relevant biomarkers involved in complex clinical phenotypes of diverse biological systems suggesting that metabolomics is a key tool for biomarker discovery. In the present review, the Five Domains model has been employed as a <i>vademecum</i> describing AW. Starting from the individual Domains-nutrition (I), environment (II), health (III), behavior (IV), and mental state (V)-applications and advances of metabolomics related to AW setting aimed at investigating phenotypic outcomes on molecular scale and elucidating the biological routes most perturbed from external solicitations, are reviewed. Strengths and weaknesses of the current state-of-art are highlighted, and new frontiers to be explored for AW assessment throughout the metabolomics approach are argued. Moreover, a detailed description of metabolomics workflow is provided to understand dos and don'ts at experimental level to pursue effective results.

However, its improvement of hyperlipidemia is still unclear, and the same is true with regard to its mechanism. In this study, a high-fat diet (HFD) was used to induce a hyperlipidemic rat model. The metabolites of genistin in normal and hyperlipidemic rats were first identified to cause metabolic differences with Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Exactive Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS). The relevant factors were determined via ELISA, and the pathological changes of liver tissue were examined via H&amp;E staining and Oil red O staining, which evaluated the functions of genistin. The related mechanism was elucidated through metabolomics and Spearman correlation analysis. The results showed that 13 metabolites of genistin were identified in plasma from normal and hyperlipidemic rats. Of those metabolites, seven were found in normal rat, and three existed in two models, with those metabolites being involved in the reactions of decarbonylation, arabinosylation, hydroxylation, and methylation. Three metabolites, including the product of dehydroxymethylation, decarbonylation, and carbonyl hydrogenation, were identified in hyperlipidemic rats for the first time. Accordingly, the pharmacodynamic results first revealed that genistin could significantly reduce the level of lipid factors (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), inhibited lipid accumulation in the liver, and reversed the liver function abnormalities caused by lipid peroxidation. For metabolomics results, HFD could significantly alter the levels of 15 endogenous metabolites, and genistin could reverse them.

Starting from these background conditions, the aim of this work was to shed light, for the first time, on the chemical modifications of a typical Italian PDO meat product-namely, Coppa Piacentina-during ripening, to find correlations between its sensory quality and the biomarker compounds related to the progress of ripening. The ripening time (from 60 to 240 days) was found to deeply modify the chemical composition of this typical meat product, providing potential biomarkers of both oxidative reactions and sensory attributes. The chemical analyses revealed that there is typically a significant decrease in the moisture content during ripening, likely due to increased dehydration. In addition, the fatty acid profile showed that the distribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) decreased during ripening, because of their high susceptibility to oxidation and conversion to intermediate and secondary molecules. An untargeted metabolomics approach, coupled with unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistics, highlighted a significant impact (prediction scores &gt; 1) of lipid oxidation during ripening time, with some metabolites (such as &#x3b3; -glutamyl-peptides, hydroperoxy-fatty acids, and glutathione) being particularly discriminant in predicting the changes observed. The discriminant metabolites were coherent with the progressive increase of peroxide values determined during the entire ripening period. Finally, the sensory analysis outlined that the highest degree of ripening provided greater color intensity of the lean part, slice firmness, and chewing consistency, with glutathione and &#x3b3;-glutamyl-glutamic acid establishing the highest number of significant correlations with the sensory attributes evaluated.

A range of analytical columns (C18 and biphenyl columns) and mobile phases (acidic and alkaline) were systematically evaluated. The optimized LC-MS method was based on a biphenyl column, a water-methanol gradient with 0.2% formic acid, and authentic isotope-labeled standards for each kynurenine metabolite. Precision and accuracy of targeted quantification of the key kynurenine metabolites tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and QUIN were excellent, far exceeding the acceptance criteria specified by international guidelines.

Here, we conducted a widely targeted lipidomic analysis of 38 human serum samples in a discovery set and 40 human serum samples in a validation set to profile the dysregulated lipid species and establish lipid biomarkers for early-stage EC. This comprehensive lipidomic determination of 616 serum lipids indicated significant differences between early-stage EC patients and healthy controls. Three phases of lipid biomarker investigation (discovery, validation, and determination of the lipid biomarker panel) were performed, which revealed the upregulation of some sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and glycerolipids and downregulation of some carnitine. Consistently, the perturbation of sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism was also observed from pathway enrichment analysis. Moreover, a lipid biomarker panel, including ursodeoxycholic acid, PC(O-14:0_20:4), and Cer(d18:1/18:0), was established. This panel was assessed as an effective diagnostic model to distinguish early-stage EC patients from healthy controls and atypical endometrial hyperplasia patients within the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) reaching 0.903 and 0.928, respectively. In particular, the comparison results of the diagnostic efficacy indicated that the lipid biomarker panel was superior to clinically established indicators for EC diagnosis, including HE4, CA125, CA153, and CA199, suggesting that it could be used as an excellent supplementary method for the diagnosis of early-stage EC. In conclusion, we established a novel and non-invasive lipid biomarker for early-stage EC detection and these findings may provide new insight into the pathological mechanisms of EC.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

In contrast, the metabolome is an intuitive discriminative biomarker as a small molecular bridge to distinguish CRC from healthy individuals due to the direct action of microbes on the host. More diagnostic microbial markers have been found, and the potential discriminatory power of microorganisms in CRC has been investigated through the combined use of biomic genomic metabolomics, bringing new ideas for screening fecal microbial markers.

Due to their heterogeneity, different isolation methods may enrich distinct exosome cargos generating different omic profiles. In this study, we evaluated the effects of plasma exosome isolation methods on detectable multi-omic profiles in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and healthy controls, and developed an algorithm to quantify exosome enrichment. Plasma exosomes were isolated from CRPC (n = 10), NSCLC (n = 14), and healthy controls (n = 10) using three different methods: size exclusion chromatography (SEC), lectin binding, and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 4 (TIM4) binding. Molecular profiles were determined by mass spectrometry of extracted exosome fractions. Enrichment analysis of uniquely detected molecules was performed for each method with MetaboAnalyst. The exosome enrichment index (EEI) scores methods based on top differential molecules between patient groups. The lipidomic analysis detected 949 lipids using exosomes from SEC, followed by 246 from lectin binding and 226 from TIM4 binding. The detectable metabolites showed SEC identifying 191 while lectin binding and TIM4 binding identified 100 and 107, respectively. When comparing uniquely detected molecules, different methods showed preferential enrichment of different sets of molecules with SEC enriching the greatest diversity. Compared to controls, SEC identified 28 lipids showing significant difference in NSCLC, while only 1 metabolite in NSCLC and 5 metabolites in CRPC were considered statistically significant (FDR &lt; 0.1). Neither lectin-binding- nor TIM4-binding-derived exosome lipids or metabolites demonstrated significant differences between patient groups. We observed the highest EEI from SEC in lipids (NSCLC: 871.33) which was also noted in metabolites. These results support that the size exclusion method of exosome extraction implemented by SBI captures more heterogeneous exosome populations. In contrast, lectin-binding and TIM4-binding methods bind surface glycans or phosphatidylserine moieties of the exosomes. Overall, these findings suggest that specific isolation methods select subpopulations which may significantly impact cancer biomarker discovery.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Despite this, the molecular mechanisms of disease, particularly the effect on the body beyond the gastrointestinal tract, are still poorly understood. To highlight host-parasite-microbiome biochemical interactions, we utilised integrated metabolomics-16S rRNA genomics and metabolomics-proteomics approaches in a C57BL/6J mouse model of giardiasis and compared these to <i>Cryptosporidium</i> and uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (UPEC) infections. Comprehensive samples (faeces, blood, liver, and luminal contents from duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and colon) were collected 10 days post infection and subjected to proteome and metabolome analysis by liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Microbial populations in faeces and luminal washes were examined using 16S rRNA metagenomics. Proteome-metabolome analyses indicated that 12 and 16 key pathways were significantly altered in the gut and liver, respectively, during giardiasis with respect to other infections. Energy pathways including glycolysis and supporting pathways of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and the redox pathway of glutathione metabolism, were upregulated in small intestinal luminal contents and the liver during giardiasis. Metabolomics-16S rRNA genetics integration indicated that populations of three bacterial families-<i>Autopobiaceae</i> (Up), <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i> (Up), and <i>Akkermanasiaceae</i> (Down)-were most significantly affected across the gut during giardiasis, causing upregulated glycolysis and short-chained fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism.

It comprises several pathophysiological pathways, such as endothelial dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, extracellular matrix deposition and intense inflammatory system activation. Until now, HFpEF has only been described with regard to clinical features and its most commonly associated risk factors, disregarding all biological mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular deteriorations. Recently, innovations in laboratory and metabolomic findings have shown that HFpEF appears to be strictly related to specific cells and molecular mechanisms' dysregulation. Indeed, some biomarkers are efficient in early identification of these processes, adding new insights into diagnosis and risk stratification. Moreover, recent advances in intermediate metabolites provide relevant information on intrinsic cellular and energetic substrate alterations. Therefore, a systematic combination of clinical imaging and laboratory findings may lead to a 'precision medicine' approach providing prognostic and therapeutic advantages. The current review reports traditional and emerging biomarkers in HFpEF and it purposes a new diagnostic approach based on integrative information achieved from risk factor burden, hemodynamic dysfunction and biomarkers' signature partnership.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

However, most metabolomic studies use biological fluids such as blood and urine as biospecimens, which could be dramatically influenced by daily activities and dietary variation, resulting in measurement fluctuations. In contrast, hair may serve as a robust source of stable longitudinal metabolite information. Here, we conducted a pilot study to investigate the possibility of using hair as a biospecimen for the metabolomic analysis of cervical cancer. Hair, plasma, urine, and cervical tissue samples from cervical cancer and benign tumor patients were collected. Biospecimens were then tested using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic platform. The expressions of enzymatic genes related to metabolic changes were validated using qPCR. Statistical analyses were calculated via the R-console platform. Metabolite profiles in both hair and cervical tissue samples were significantly different between cancer and control groups, while no difference was observed in plasma and urine samples. Further analysis showed that most of the altered metabolites in hair were upregulated, and they had a negative correlation with those in the cervical tissue. Eight common metabolites showed an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve greater than 0.95. These metabolites primarily participated in amino acid metabolism, cofactor synthesis, ferroptosis, and glycolysis. The gene expressions (IDH1, OGDH, GLUD1, ENO1, GSS, and GPX4) associated with the shortlisted metabolic pathways were also upregulated.

This study attempts to elucidate the dysregulated proteins driving colorectal cancer (CRC). To explore the differential proteins, we performed iTRAQ labeling proteomics and TMT labeling phosphoproteomics analysis of CRC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The functions of quantified proteins were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Subcellular localization analysis. Depending on the results, we identified 330 differential proteins and 82 phosphoproteins in CRC. GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that protein changes were primarily associated with regulating biological and metabolic processes through binding to other molecules. Co-expression relationships between proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that TMC5, SMC4, SLBP, VSIG2, and NDRG2 were significantly dysregulated differential proteins. Additionally, based on the predicted co-expression proteins, we identified that the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) was up-regulated in CRC cells and promoted the proliferation and migration of CRC.

To examine the growth of neurons <i>in vitro</i>, a quantitative method for the simultaneous measurement of <i>N</i>-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) and <i>N</i>-acetylglutamic acid (NAG) in a culture medium was established. The analysis of endogenous NAA and NAG concentrations over 28 days of neural cell culture not only illustrated the growth and maturation process of neural progenitors, but also confirmed the successful achievement of human neural constructs.

Omics is a concept in biological research that aims to comprehensively characterize and quantify large numbers of biological molecules in complex samples, e.g., proteins (proteomics), low molecular weight molecules (metabolomics), glycans (glycomics) or amphiphilic molecules (lipidomics). Over the past decades, respective unbiased discovery approaches have been intensively applied to&#xa0;investigate functional physiological and pathophysiological relationships in various research study cohorts. In the context of clinical diagnostics, omics approaches seem to have potential in two main areas: (i)&#xa0;biomarker discovery i.e. identification of individual marker analytes for subsequent translation into diagnostics (as classical target analyses with conventional laboratory techniques), and (ii) the readout of&#xa0;complex, higher-dimensional signatures of diagnostic samples, in particular by means of spectrometric techniques in combination with biomathematical approaches of pattern&#xa0;recognition and artificial intelligence for diagnostic classification. Resulting diagnostic methods could potentially represent a disruptive paradigm shift away from current one-dimensional (i.e.,&#xa0;single analyte marker based) laboratory diagnostics. The underlying hypothesis of omics approaches for diagnostics is that complex, multigenic pathologies can be more accurately diagnosed via the readout of \"omics-type signatures\" than with the current one-dimensional single marker diagnostic procedures. While this is indeed promising, one must realize that the clinical translation of high-dimensional analytical procedures into routine diagnostics brings completely new challenges with respect to long-term reproducibility and analytical standardization, data management, and quality assurance.

Stress exposure can either culminate in the organism's adaptation or aggravate into a metabolic shutdown, characterized by irreversible cellular damage and deleterious effects on fish performance, welfare, and survival. Multiomics can improve our understanding of the complex stressed phenotype in fish and the molecular mediators that regulate the underlying processes of the molecular stress response. We profiled the stress proteome and metabolome of <i>Sparus aurata</i> responding to different challenges common to aquaculture production, characterizing the disturbed pathways in the fish liver, i.e., the central organ in mounting the stress response. Label-free shotgun proteomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses identified 1738 proteins and 120 metabolites, separately. Mass spectrometry data have been made fully accessible via ProteomeXchange, with the identifier PXD036392, and via MetaboLights, with the identifier MTBLS5940. Integrative multivariate statistical analysis, performed with data integration analysis for biomarker discovery using latent components (DIABLO), depicted the 10 most-relevant features. Functional analysis of these selected features revealed an intricate network of regulatory components, modulating different signaling pathways related to cellular stress, e.g., the mTORC1 pathway, the unfolded protein response, endocytosis, and autophagy to different extents according to the stress nature.

Investigations on dietary patterns rather than single food components are gaining in popularity because they take the complexity of the whole dietary context into account. Adherence to such dietary patterns can be measured by using metabolomics, which allows measurements of thousands of molecules simultaneously. Derived metabolite signatures of dietary patterns may reflect the consumption of specific groups of foods or their constituents originating from the dietary pattern per se, or the physiological response toward the food-derived metabolites, their interaction with endogenous metabolism, and exogenous factors such as gut microbiota. Here, we review and discuss blood metabolite fingerprints of healthy dietary patterns. The plasma concentration of several food-derived metabolites-such as betaines from whole grains and n&#xa0;-&#xa0;3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and furan fatty acids from fish-seems to consistently reflect the intake of common foods of several healthy dietary patterns. The metabolites reflecting shared features of different healthy food indices form biomarker panels for which specific, targeted assays could be developed. The specificity of such biomarker panels would need to be validated, and proof-of-concept feeding trials are needed to evaluate to what extent the panels may mediate the effects of dietary patterns on disease risk indicators or if they are merely food intake biomarkers.

Recently, much attention has been given to the role of metabolic alteration in cancers, expanding from the Warburg effect to highlight unique patterns in different cancer cell populations for improving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We recently reported on modulation of mannosylation of &#x3b1;-dystroglycan with the metabolite ribitol in breast cancer lines. Here we investigate the effects of pentose sugars ribitol, ribose, and xylitol media supplementation in breast cancer cells by metabolomics and differential gene expression profiling. This combined approach revealed distinctive patterns of alterations in metabolic pathways by ribitol, contrasted with the closely related pentose ribose and pentitol xylitol. Significantly, ribitol supplementation enhances utilization of glucose by glycolysis, whereas ribose improves oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid synthesis. Ribitol supplementation also increased levels of reduced glutathione (associated with a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, gluconeogenesis), where ribose supplementation elevated levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) indicating an increase in oxidative stress. Treatment with ribitol also enhanced nucleotide biosynthesis. The apparent TCA cycle dysregulation, with distinctive pattern in response to the individual pentitol and pentose, such as ribitol increasing succinate and fumarate while decreasing citrate, demonstrate the adaptive capability of cancer cells to nutritional environment.

Despite its vital importance, little is known about the metabolomic signatures among fungal species and nutritional modes (rot types). In this study, we used GC-MS metabolomics in solid wood substrates (<i>in planta</i>) to compare brown rot fungi (Rhodonia placenta and Gloeophylum trabeum) and white rot fungi (Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus) at two decay stages (earlier and later), finding identifiable patterns for brown rot fungi at later decay stages. These patterns occurred in highly reducing environments that were not observed in white rot fungi. Metabolomes measured among the two white rot fungi were notably different, but we found a potential biomarker compound, galactitol, that was characteristic to white rot taxa. In addition, we found that white rot fungi were more efficient at catabolizing phenolic compounds that were originally present in wood. Collectively, white rot fungi were characterized by measured sugar release relative to higher carbohydrate solubilization by brown rot fungi, a distinction in soluble sugar availability that might shape success in the face of \"cheater\" competitors. This need to protect excess free sugars may explain the differentially high brown rot fungal production of pyranones and furanones, likely linked to an expansion of polyketide synthase genes. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Despite the ecological and economic importance of wood-degrading fungi, little is known about the array of metabolites that fungi produce during wood decomposition. This study provides an in-depth insight into the wood decomposition process by analyzing and comparing the changes of &gt;100 compounds produced by fungi with metabolic distinct nutritional modes (white and brown rot fungi) at different decay stages. We found a unique pattern of metabolites that correlated well with brown rot (carbohydrate selective mode) in later decay. These compounds were in line with some of the physiochemical and genetic features previously seen in these fungi such as a faster sugar release, lower pH, and the expansion of polyketide-synthase genes compared to white rot fungi (lignin-degrading mode).

For this purpose, males and females were exposed to a continuous flow of diclofenac solution in laboratory for 21 days, followed by 3 days of depuration, to nominal concentrations of 1 (low) and 100 &#x3bc;g/L (high) of DCF. A methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was employed. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses were combined to evaluate the modulations of the liver metabolome of G. aculeatus after exposure to DCF. The metabolomics data revealed variations both as a function of time and of the DCF concentration.

One advantage of LC-MS is that it can serve both as a biomarker discovery tool and as a platform for clinical diagnostics. Consequently, it offers an exciting opportunity to potentially transition research studies into real-world clinical tools. One important distinction between research versus diagnostics-based applications of LC-MS is throughput. Clinical LC-MS must enable quantitative analyses of target molecules in hundreds or thousands of samples each day. Currently, the throughput of these clinical applications is limited by the chromatographic gradient lengths, which-when analyzing complex metabolomics samples-are difficult to conduct in under&#x2009;~&#x2009;3&#xa0;min per sample without introducing serious quantitative analysis problems. To address this shortcoming, we developed sequential quantification using isotope dilution (SQUID), an analytical strategy that combines serial sample injections into a continuous isocratic mobile phase to maximize throughput. SQUID uses internal isotope-labelled standards to correct for changes in LC-MS response factors over time. We show that SQUID can detect microbial polyamines in human urine specimens (lower limit of quantification; LLOQ&#x2009;=&#x2009;106&#xa0;nM) with less than 0.019 normalized root mean square error.

Herein, we proposed a simple methodology that enables the comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of polar metabolites using unified-hydrophilic-interaction/anion-exchange liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (unified-HILIC/AEX/MS) with a polymer-based mixed amines column composed of methacrylate-based polymer particles with primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary amines as functional groups. The optimized unified-HILIC/AEX/MS method is composed of two consecutive chromatographic separations, HILIC-dominant separation for cationic, uncharged, and zwitterionic polar metabolites [retention times (RTs) = 0-12.8 min] and AEX-dominant separation for polar anionic metabolites (RTs = 12.8-26.5 min), by varying the ratio of acetonitrile to 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (pH 9.8). A total of 400 polar metabolites were analyzed simultaneously through a combination of highly efficient separation using unified-HILIC/AEX and remarkably sensitive detection using multiple reaction monitoring-based triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (unified-HILIC/AEX/MS/MS). A nontargeted metabolomic approach using unified-HILIC/AEX high-resolution mass spectrometry (unified-HILIC/AEX/HRMS) also provided more comprehensive information on polar metabolites (3242 metabolic features) in HeLa cell extracts than the conventional HILIC/HRMS method (2068 metabolic features). Our established unified-HILIC/AEX/MS/MS and unified-HILIC/AEX/HRMS methods have several advantages over conventional techniques, including polar metabolome coverage, throughput, and accurate quantitative performance, and represent potentially useful tools for in-depth studies on metabolism and biomarker discovery.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

Asthma-COPD overlap, referred to as ACO, is another complex pulmonary disease that manifests itself with features of both asthma and COPD. The disease has no clear diagnostic or therapeutic guidelines, thereby making both diagnosis and treatment challenging. Though a number of studies on ACO have been documented, gaps in knowledge regarding the pathophysiologic mechanism of this disorder exist. Addressing this issue is an urgent need for improved diagnostic and therapeutic management of the disease. Metabolomics, an increasingly popular technique, reveals the pathogenesis of complex diseases and holds promise in biomarker discovery. This comprehensive narrative review, comprising 99 original research articles in the last five years (2017-2022), summarizes the scientific advances in terms of metabolic alterations in patients with asthma, COPD, and ACO. The analytical tools, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), commonly used to study the expression of the metabolome, are discussed.

However, widespread use is deterred by the development of clinically significant acute inflammatory toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), that induce significant morbidity and require close monitoring. Identification of host biochemical signatures that predict the severity and time-to-onset of CRS and ICANS may assist patient stratification to enable timely mitigation strategies. Here, we report pretreatment host metabolites that are associated with CRS and ICANS induced by axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel therapy. Both untargeted metabolomics analysis and validation using targeted assays revealed a significant association between the abundance of specific pretreatment biochemical entities and an increased risk and/or onset of clinically significant CRS (q&#xa0;&lt; .1) and ICANS (q&#xa0;&lt; .25). Higher pretreatment levels of plasma glucose and lower levels of cholesterol and glutamate were associated with a faster onset of CRS. In contrast, low baseline levels of the amino acids proline and glycine and the secondary bile acid isoursodeoxycholate were significantly correlated with clinically significant CRS. Lower concentration of the amino acid hydroxyproline was associated with higher grade and faster onset of ICANS, whereas low glutamine was negatively correlated with faster development of ICANS. Overall, our data indicate that the pretreatment host metabolome has biomarker potential in determining the risk of clinically significant CRS and ICANS, and may be useful in risk stratification of patients before anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

The metabolic impact persists even after farm animal skeletal muscle is converted to edible meat through postmortem rigor mortis and aging. Muscle metabolites resulting from animal growth and postmortem storage have a significant impact on meat quality, including flavor and color. Metabolomics studies of postmortem muscle aging have identified metabolisms that contain signatures inherent to muscle properties and the altered metabolites by physiological adaptation, with glycolysis as the pivotal metabolism in postmortem aging. Metabolomics has also played a role in mining relevant postmortem metabolisms and pathways, such as the citrate cycle and mitochondrial metabolism. This leads to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generation of key compounds that are associated with meat quality. Genetic background, feeding strategy, and muscle type primarily determine skeletal muscle properties in live animals and affect post-mortem muscle metabolism. With comprehensive metabolite detection, metabolomics is also beneficial for exploring biomarker candidates that could be useful to monitor meat production and predict the quality traits.

An untargeted metabolomics-based approach was applied in a case-control study with 193 NSCLC patients and 243 healthy controls. Serum metabolomics were determined by using an ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method. We screened differential metabolites based on univariate and multivariate analysis, followed by identification of the metabolites and related pathways. For NSCLC detection, machine learning was employed to develop and validate the model based on the altered serum metabolite features. The serum metabolic pattern of NSCLC was definitely different from the healthy condition. In total, 278 altered features were found in the serum of NSCLC patients comparing with healthy people. About one-fifth of the abundant differential features were identified successfully. The altered metabolites were enriched in metabolic pathways such as phenylalanine metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of bile acids. We demonstrated a panel of 10 metabolic biomarkers which representing excellent discriminating capability for NSCLC discrimination, with a combined area under the curve (AUC) in the validation set of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98). Moreover, this model showed a desirable performance for the detection of NSCLC at an early stage (AUC&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.97). Our study offers a perspective on NSCLC metabolic alteration.

Sixty-four percent of the patients were resistant to chemotherapy. NMR, hormonal receptors (HR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and the nuclear protein Ki67 were combined through machine learning (ML) to predict the response to NACT.

With the utilization of metabolomics, dysregulated production of several metabolic components in human plasma, such as lipids, amino acids, androgens and estrogens, was found to be important in the pathogenesis of PE. Transcriptomics adds more in-depth information, and the integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics may yield further insight into PE pathogenesis than either one alone. <b>Objectives:</b> We investigated the placental metabolomics and transcriptomics of PE patients to identify affected metabolic pathways and potential biological targets for exploring the disease pathogenesis. <b>Methods:</b> Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics were used to analyze five paired human placentas from patients with severe PE and normal pregnancies. This was followed by further validation of our findings in a publicly available dataset of 173&#xa0;PE vs. 157 control placentas. In addition, weighted gene coexpression network construction was performed to assess the correlation between genetic alterations and diseases. <b>Results:</b> We identified 66 and 41 differentially altered metabolites in negative and positive ion modes, respectively, in the PE group compared to the control group, and found 2,560 differentially expressed genes. Several pathways were aberrantly altered in the PE placenta at both the metabolic and transcriptional levels, including steroid hormone biosynthesis, the cAMP signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, taste transduction and prion diseases.

However, the metabolic biomarkers identifying malignant degrees and therapeutic efficacy are still largely unknown in the disease. Here, GC-MS-based metabolomics was used to understand metabolic alteration in 137 serum specimens from patients with esophageal cancer, which is approximately two- to fivefold as many plasma specimens as the previous reports. The elevated amino acid metabolism is in sharp contrast to the reduced carbohydrate as a characteristic feature of esophageal cancer. Comparative metabolomics showed that most metabolic differences were determined between the early stage (0-II) and the late stage (III and IV) among the 0-IV stages of esophageal cancer and between patients who received treatment and those who did not receive treatment. Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism and glycine were identified as the potentially overlapped metabolic pathway and metabolite, respectively, in both disease progress and treatment effect. Glycine, fructose, ornithine, and threonine can be a potential array for the evaluation of disease prognosis and therapy in esophageal cancer.

The prediction of the clinical course of patients with diabetic kidney disease remains difficult, despite the identification of potential biomarkers; therefore, novel biomarkers are needed to predict the progression of the disease. We conducted non-targeted metabolomics using plasma and urine of patients with diabetic kidney disease whose estimated glomerular filtration rate was between 30 and 60&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup>. We analyzed how the estimated glomerular filtration rate changed over time (up to 30&#xa0;months) to detect rapid decliners of kidney function. Conventional logistic analysis suggested that only one metabolite, urinary 1-methylpyridin-1-ium (NMP), was a promising biomarker. We then applied a deep learning method to identify potential biomarkers and physiological parameters to predict the progression of diabetic kidney disease in an explainable manner. We narrowed down 3388 variables to 50 using the deep learning method and conducted two regression models, piecewise linear and handcrafted linear regression, both of which examined the utility of biomarker combinations. Our analysis, based on the deep learning method, identified systolic blood pressure and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, six identified metabolites, and three unidentified metabolites including urinary NMP, as potential biomarkers.

However, these compounds have often been identified from top-down strategies and have not been fully utilized as a substitute for traditional DDI studies. In an attempt to eliminate observer bias in biomarker selection, we applied a bottom-up, untargeted metabolomics screening approach in mice and found that plasma levels of the conjugated bile acid chenodeoxycholate-24-glucuronide (CDCA-24G) are particularly sensitive to deletion of the orthologous murine transporter Oatp1b2 (31-fold increase vs. wild type) or the entire Oatp1a/1b(-/-)cluster (83-fold increased), whereas the humanized transgenic overexpression of hepatic OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 resulted in the partial restoration of transport function. Validation studies with the OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitors rifampin and paclitaxel in vitro as well as in mice and human subjects confirmed that CDCA-24G is a sensitive and rapid response biomarker to dose-dependent transporter inhibition.

To test the performance of MIX, we generated synthetic data closely resembling real finger sweat metabolome measurements. We show that MIX normalization successfully tackles key weaknesses of the individual strategies: it (i) reduces the risk of overfitting with PKM, and (ii), contrary to PQN, it allows to compute sample volumes. Finally, we validate MIX by using real finger sweat as well as blood plasma metabolome data and demonstrate that MIX allows to better and more robustly correct for size effects.

Current advances in evaluating candidate biomarkers for psychiatric diseases, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), focus on determining a specific biomarker signature or profile. The origins of candidate biomarkers are heterogenous, ranging from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, while incorporating associations with clinical characterization. Prior to clinical use, candidate biomarkers must be validated by large multi-site clinical studies, which can be used to determine the ideal MDD biomarker signature. Therefore, identifying valid biomarkers has been challenging, suggesting the need for alternative approaches. Following validation studies, new technology must be employed to transition from biomarker discovery to diagnostic biomolecular profiling. Current technologies used in discovery and validation, such as mass spectroscopy, are currently limited to clinical research due to the cost or complexity of equipment, sample preparation, or measurement analysis. Thus, other technologies such as electrochemical detection must be considered for point-of-care (POC) testing with the needed characteristics for physicians' offices. This review evaluates the advantages of using electrochemical sensing as a primary diagnostic platform due to its rapidity, accuracy, low cost, biomolecular detection diversity, multiplexed capacity, and instrument flexibility. We evaluate the capabilities of electrochemical methods in evaluating current candidate MDD biomarkers, individually and through multiplexed sensing, for promising applications in detecting MDD biosignatures in the POC setting.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

The standard method for diagnosis of schistosomiasis is detection of parasite eggs from patient samples. However, this method is not sufficient to detect asymptomatic patients, low egg numbers, or early infection. Therefore, diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity at the early stage of the disease are needed to fill this gap. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of early schistosomiasis using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Serum of uninfected and <i>S. mekongi</i>-infected mice was collected at 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-infection. Samples were extracted for metabolites and analyzed with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer. Metabolites were annotated with the MS-DIAL platform and analyzed with Metaboanalyst bioinformatic tools. Multivariate analysis distinguished between metabolites from the different experimental conditions. Biomarker screening was performed using three methods: correlation coefficient analysis; feature important detection with a random forest algorithm; and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Three compounds were identified as potential biomarkers at the early stage of the disease: heptadecanoyl ethanolamide; picrotin; and theophylline. The levels of these three compounds changed significantly during early-stage infection, and therefore these molecules may be promising schistosomiasis markers. These findings may help to improve early diagnosis of schistosomiasis, thus reducing the burden on patients and limiting spread of the disease in endemic areas.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

This study aimed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of Lactobacillus paracasei CCFM1222 against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice and further elaborate its mechanism of action from the perspective of intestinal microbiomics and metabolomics. The results displayed that L. paracasei CCFM1222 pretreatment significantly decreased the serum ALT, and AST levels, inhibited the releases of hepatic TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, and IL-6 levels, and activated the SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px activities in LPS-treated mice. The cecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) levels were increased in LPS-treated mice with L. paracasei CCFM1222 pretreatment. In addition, L. paracasei CCFM1222 pretreatment remarkably shifted the intestinal microbiota composition, including the higher abundance of Faecalibaculum, Bifidobacterium, and lower abundance of the Prevotellaceae NK3B31 group, which is positively associated with the cecal propionic, butyric, valeric, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids. The metabolomics based on UPLC-QTOF/MS revealed that L. paracasei CCFM1222 pretreatment significantly regulated the composition of feces metabolites in LPS-treated mice, especially the potential biomarker-related butanoate metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, caffeine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, arginine, and proline metabolism.

Cacao harvesting is not a standardized practice because farmers harvest between six up to eight months from flowering, guided by pod's color and shape. The mixture of cacao beans from different ripening stages (RS), negatively affecting the quality and price of grain. A way to help the farmers in the harvest standardization could be through the use of chemical markers and visual indicators of CPH ripening. This study analyses CPH's metabolic distribution of two cacao clones, ICS95 and CCN51 at six, seven, and eight months of ripening. Untargeted metabolomics was done using HPLC-MS/MS for biomarker discovery and association to cacao ripening. The results indicated a strong metabolic differentiation of the sixth month with the rest of the months independent of the variety. Also, metabolic differences were found between cacao clones for the seventh and eighth month. We annotated five potential biochemical markers including 3-caffeoylpelargodinin 5-glucoside, indoleacetaldehyde, procyanidin A dimer, procyanidin C1, and kaempferol. We further looked for correlation between patterns of progression of our markers against quantitative indicators of CPH appearance and texture, at the same ripening stages. We also performed a functional analysis and three possible metabolic pathways: flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism were identified associated with stress sensing, plant development and defense respectively. We found significant and positive correlations between green color density and all metabolites. For texture, the correlations were significantly negative with all metabolites. Our results suggest that about the sixth month is appropriate for harvesting cacao in the region of Caldas, Colombia in order to avoid all the metabolic variations occurring at later stages of ripening which impact the cacao bean quality. Therefore, studying the cacao ripening process can help in the estimation of the best harvest time and contribute to the standardization of harvest practices.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

The increase in glutamine in glaucoma is also relevant because it could be a means of keeping the concentration of glutamate under control, thus avoiding its potential to induce the death of neurons and retinal cells. Equally notable was the increase in kynurenine, which is essential in the metabolism of nicotine adenine dinucleotides.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

However, discrepancies can be noted with the content of the same biomarker being increased or decreased for a given disease. Differences in the way saliva is collected, stored, and/or treated could cause these discrepancies. Indeed, there is no standardized method for saliva sampling and analysis. In this work, two chromatographic modes were used, i.e., RP-LC and HILIC both coupled to MS used in positive and negative ionization modes. The analytical conditions were optimized with a mixture of 90 compounds naturally present in saliva, representative of the wide range of molecular mass and polarity of salivary metabolites and being described as having a differential expression in various pathologies. These four methods were applied to the analysis of saliva samples collected by spitting, aspiration, or Salivette&#xae; with or without prior rinsing of the mouth. Rinsing had an effect on some metabolite concentrations. As it can induce an additional parameter of variability to the sampling, it seems therefore preferable to use methods without rinsing while effects of these parameters on the metabolites are investigated. Saliva obtained by spitting and aspiration gave statistically equivalent results for 84% of the metabolites studied. Conversely, Salivette&#xae; gave different results since the majority of the metabolites chosen for the study were not quantified in the samples. The Salivette&#xae; does not seem therefore to be a suitable sampling method for an untargeted analysis of the salivary metabolome, unlike aspiration and spitting.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

However, its therapeutic mechanism is not clear, so this paper conducted a preliminary study on its vitro anti-tumour mechanism and metabonomics to find out its impact. It was found that the drug-loaded micelles (PEG<sub>2K</sub> -FIbu/NIC) had an inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells. Moreover, it can promote apoptosis of HepG2 cells and block S and G2/M phase of cell cycle. The plasma and liver metabolomics of mice in normal group, model group and administration group were studied by UPLC-MS and <sup>1</sup> H-NMR.

During differential abundance analysis, dropping samples with missing values can lead to severe loss of data as well as biased results in group comparisons and effect size estimates. However, the imputation of missing data (the process of replacing missing data with estimated values such as a mean) may compromise the inherent intra-subject correlation of a metabolite across multiple biospecimens from the same subject, which in turn may compromise the efficacy of the statistical analysis of differential metabolites in biomarker discovery. We investigated imputation strategies when considering multiple biospecimens from the same subject. We compared a novel, but simple, approach that consists of combining the two biospecimen data matrices (rows and columns of subjects and metabolites) and imputes the two biospecimen data matrices together to an approach that imputes each biospecimen data matrix separately. We then compared the bias in the estimation of the intra-subject multi-specimen correlation and its effects on the validity of statistical significance tests between two approaches. The combined approach to multi-biospecimen studies has not been evaluated previously even though it is intuitive and easy to implement. We examine these two approaches for five imputation methods: random forest, k nearest neighbor, expectation-maximization with bootstrap, quantile regression, and half the minimum observed value. Combining the biospecimen data matrices for imputation did not greatly increase efficacy in conserving the correlation structure or improving accuracy in the statistical conclusions for most of the methods examined. Random forest tended to outperform the other methods in all performance metrics, except specificity.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

However, long-term PN is accompanied by severe complications such as catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), and it is associated with high healthcare costs. In this study, we characterized the plasma metabolomic profile and investigated the role of metabolism in predicting long-term PN in pediatric patients with SBS. Untargeted metabolomics was performed in plasma samples from 20 SBS patients with PN support: 6 patients had IFALD and 14 patients had no liver disease. As controls, 18 subjects without liver or intestinal diseases were included for the analysis. SBS patients had distinct plasma metabolomic signatures compared to controls, and several pathways associated with amino acid metabolism and cell death were significantly changed. The presence of IFALD in SBS was associated with alterations of metabolites mainly classified as \"amino acids, peptides, and analogues\" and \"benzene and derivatives\". Serum direct bilirubin levels were negatively correlated with levels of uridine, skatole, and glabrol. Importantly, SBS patients with long-term PN showed significantly increased levels of glutamine compared to those in the short-term PN group. Finally, using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we developed a prediction model including glutamine and creatinine to identify pediatric SBS patients who need long-term PN support. These findings underscore the potential key role of the metabolome in SBS with IF and suggest that metabolomic profiles could be used in long-term PN assessment.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

To understand a complex biological process, it is important to apply an integrative approach that analyses the multi-omics data in order to highlight the possible interrelationships of the involved biomolecules and their functions. Furthermore, these omics technologies offer an important opportunity to understand the information that underlies disease. In the current review, we will discuss the importance of omics technologies as promising tools to understand the role of different biomolecules in diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

The aim of the study was to determine if early weaning and milk substitutes affect the gut microbiota, metabolism, and immunological status of goat kids suffering from diarrhea. The 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing in feces and serum metabolomics of early-weaned and artificially reared goat kids suffering from diarrhea (DK group) and healthy goat kids reared by their mothers (HK group) were analyzed. The serum biochemistry and immunoglobulin concentration were also determined. Several probiotics, such as <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were higher in the feces of the DK group than in feces of the HK group. <i>Ruminococcus</i> sp. was elevated in the feces of HKs, likely being a biomarker for goat health. Taking all the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) families into consideration, 20 CAZyme families were different between the groups. Compared with the DK group, the relative quantity of glycoside hydrolases (GH) and glycosyltransferase (GT) families in the HK group decreased. GT70 was only identified in HK kids participating in the activity of &#x3b2;-glucuronosyltransferase during the carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, 24 metabolites were different between the groups, which were mainly involved in protein digestion and absorption, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. The concentrations of immunoglobulins G and M were significantly lower in the DK than in the HK group. In conclusion, our study characterized the fecal microbiota, metabolism, and immunological status of early-weaned and artificially reared goat kids suffering from diarrhea.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

With loss of FXN, mitochondrial metabolism is severely disrupted. Multiple therapeutic approaches are in development, but a key limitation is the lack of biomarkers reflecting the activity of FXN in a timely fashion. We predicted this dysregulated metabolism would present a unique metabolite profile in blood of FA patients versus Controls (Con). Plasma from 10 FA and 11 age and sex matched Con subjects was analyzed by targeted mass spectrometry and untargeted NMR. This combined approach yielded quantitative measurements for 540 metabolites and found 59 unique metabolites (55 from MS and 4 from NMR) that were significantly different between cohorts. Correlation-based network analysis revealed several clusters of pathway related metabolites including a cluster associated with one&#x2011;carbon (1C) metabolism composed of formate, sarcosine, hypoxanthine, and homocysteine. Receiver operator characteristics analyses demonstrated an excellent ability to discriminate between Con and FA with AUC values &gt;0.95. These results are the first reported metabolomic analyses of human patients with FA. The metabolic perturbations, especially those related to 1C metabolism, may serve as a valuable biomarker panel of disease progression and response to therapy. The identification of dysregulated 1C metabolism may also inform the search for new therapeutic targets related to this pathway.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

A more accurate risk stratification remains a key point in the study of NB and the availability of novel prognostic biomarkers of \"high-risk\" at diagnosis could help improving patient stratification and predicting outcome. In this paper we show a biomarker discovery approach applied to the plasma of 172 NB patients. Plasma samples from a first cohort of NB patients and age-matched healthy controls were used for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Differential expression analysis highlighted a number of metabolites annotated with a high degree of identification. Among them, 3-O-methyldopa (3-O-MD) was validated in a second cohort of NB patients using a targeted metabolite profiling approach and its prognostic potential was also analyzed by survival analysis on patients with 3 years follow-up. High expression of 3-O-MD was associated with worse prognosis in the subset of patients with stage M tumor (log-rank p &lt; 0.05) and, among them, it was confirmed as a prognostic factor able to stratify high-risk patients older than 18 months. 3-O-MD might be thus considered as a novel prognostic biomarker of NB eligible to be included at diagnosis among catecholamine metabolite panels in prospective clinical studies.

Additionally, omics techniques present clinical applicability by functional identification and validation of biomarkers. Therefore, finding molecules or patterns characteristic for distinct immune-inflammatory endotypes, can subsequently influence its development, progression, and treatment. There is a great potential to further increase the effectiveness of single omics approaches by integrating them with other omics, and nonomics data.

However, since different species may lead to systemic abnormalities in metabolomic profiles, it is urgently needed to perform a comparative metabolomics analysis between AD animal models and human patients. In this study, we integrated 78 metabolic profiles from public literatures, including 11 metabolomics studies in different AD mouse models and 67 metabolomics studies from AD patients. Metabolites and enrichment analysis were further conducted to reveal key metabolic pathways and metabolites in AD. We totally identified 14 key metabolites and 16 pathways that are both differentially significant in AD mouse models and patients. Moreover, we built a metabolite-target network to predict potential protein markers in AD. Finally, we validated HER2 and NDF2 as key protein markers in APP/PS1 mice. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive strategy for AD metabolomics research, contributing to understanding the pathological mechanism of AD.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

We investigated the feasibility and use of feather pulp for novel biomarker discovery using <sup>1</sup>H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics. To this end, high quality NMR metabolomic spectra were obtained from chicken feather pulp extracted using either ultrafiltration (UF) or Bligh-Dyer methanol-chloroform (BD) methods. In total, 121 and 160 metabolites were identified using the UF and BD extraction methods, respectively, with 71 of these common to both methods. The metabolome of feather pulp differed in broiler breeders that were 1-, 23-, and 45-wk-of-age. Moreover, feather pulp was more difficult to obtain from older birds, indicating that age must be considered when targeting feather pulp as a source of biomarkers. The metabolomic profile of feather pulp obtained from 12-day-old broilers administered corticosterone differed from control birds, indicating that the metabolome of feather pulp was sensitive to induced physiological stress. A comparative examination of feather pulp and serum in broilers revealed that the feather pulp metabolome differed from that of serum but provided more information.

The poor prognosis and lack of symptoms in the early stages make early cancer diagnosis difficult. The absence of mandatory screening programmes and the lack of awareness pose to be a real challenge in a developing economy as India. Prompt intervention is required to enhance cancer patient survival statistics and to lessen the social and financial burden. Conventional screening and cytological techniques employed currently have helped to reduce the incidence of cancers considerably. However, these tests offer low sensitivity and specificity and are not widely used for risk assessment, leading to inadequate early-stage cancer diagnosis. The accomplishment of Human Genome Project (HGP) has opened doors to exciting 'omics' platforms. Promising research in genomics and proteomics has revolutionized cancer detection and screening methodologies by providing more insights in the gene expression, protein function and how specific mutation in specific genes corresponds to a particular phenotype. However, these are incompetent to translate the information into clinical applicability. Various factors such as low sensitivity, diurnal variation in protein, poor reproducibility and analytical variables are prime hurdles. Thus the focus has been shifted to metabolomics, which is a much younger platform compared to genomics and proteomics. Metabolomics focuses on endpoint metabolites, which are final products sustained in the response to genetic or environmental changes by a living system. As a result, the metabolome indicates the cell's functional condition, which is directly linked to its phenotype. Metabolic profiling aims to study the changes occurred in metabolic pathways. This metabolite profile is capable of differentiating the healthy individuals from those having cancer. The pathways that a cell takes in turning malignant are exceedingly different, owing to the fact that transformation of healthy cells to abnormal cells is linked with significant metabolic abnormalities. This review is aimed to discuss metabolomics and its potential role in early diagnosis of gynaecological cancers, viz. breast, ovarian and cervical cancer.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

First, TD broilers with the most pronounced clinical signs during the experiment were screened and faecal samples were collected for integrated microbiome and metabolomics analysis. Moreover, the diagnostic potential of identified biomarkers was further validated throughout the experiment.

In addition, a total of 189 fecal differential metabolites were identified, mainly enriched in the purine, vitamin and amino acid metabolism, which were closely associated with differential microbiota and tibia-related indicators. Furthermore, three fecal metabolites were screened, including 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which distinguished TD from normal broilers with extremely high specificity and was superior to serum bone markers.

Frequently, data derived from laboratory studies of single stressors are used to estimate risk parameters and do not adequately address scenarios where other stressors exist. Emerging 'omic technologies, notably metabolomics, provide an opportunity to address the uncertainties surrounding ecological risk assessment of multiple stressors. The objective of this study was to use metabolomic profiling to investigate the effect of multiple stressors on amphibian metamorphs. We exposed post-metamorphosis (180 days) southern leopard frogs (Lithobates sphenocephala) to the insecticide carbaryl (480 &#x3bc;g/L), predation stress, and a combined pesticide and predation stress treatment. Corticosterone analysis revealed mild support for an induction in response to predation stress alone but strongly suggests that carbaryl exposure, alone or in combination with predation cues, can significantly elevate this known biomarker in amphibians. Metabolomics analysis accurately classed, based on relative nearness, carbaryl and predation induced changes in the hepatic metabolome and biochemical fluxes appear to be associated with a similar biological response. Support vector machine analysis with recursive feature elimination of the acquired metabolomic spectra demonstrated 85-96% classification accuracy among control and all treatment groups when using the top 75 ranked retention time bins. Biochemical fluxes observed in the groups exposed to carbaryl, predation, and the combined treatment include amino acids, sugar derivatives, and purine nucleotides. Ultimately, this methodology could be used to interpret short-term toxicity assays and the presence of environmental stressors to overall metabolomic effects in non-target organisms.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

Most human listeriosis cases are associated with four serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c and 4b) within lineages I and II. The intracellular metabolic changes in L. monocytogenes from different lineages and serotypes remain unclear. Here, a non-targeted metabolomics strategy, based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) coupled with chemometrics was performed to analyze the metabolic fluctuations in the lineages and serotypes of L. monocytogenes. In the aggregate, 93 L. monocytogenes isolates (two lineages and four serotypes) were investigated, and a total of 48 differential biomarker metabolites were identified. Twenty differential metabolites were observed at the lineage level, while the others were found at the serotype level. At the lineage level, significantly lower contents (fold change [FC]&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.60) of &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was found in lineage II strains, as compared to lineage I strains. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis showed that different substances between lineages I and II participated in multiple metabolic pathways, among which pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were significantly enriched. The major significantly upregulated (P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05) metabolites, including uridine 5'-monophosphate, uridine, guanosine monophosphate, and guanosine, in lineage II strains affect the synthesis of DNA and RNA.

In addition, the upregulation of pyridoxine in the vitamin B6 pathway in 4b strains was also observed.

This study analyzed the metabolite changes in plasma between healthy controls and septic patients, as well as between survival and dead septic patients using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to identify differential metabolites. The differential metabolites and clinical indicators within 24&#xa0;h after sepsis diagnosis were run through multivariate logistic regression models to determine the 28-day, hospital, and 90-day septic mortality prediction models. The results suggested markedly changed amino acids metabolism in septic patients compared to healthy controls; 10, 4, and 22 primary differential metabolites related to amino acid and fatty acid metabolisms were identified in the survival and death groups at 28-day, hospital, and 90-day, respectively. Further, we found that model 1 (indoleacetic acid, 3-methylene-indolenine, heart rate, respiratory support, and application of pressure drugs), model 2 (lymphocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, SOFA, and L-alpha-amino-1H-pyrrole-1-hexanoic acid), and model 3 (dopamine, delta-12-prostaglandin J2, heart rate, respiratory support, and application of pressure drugs) could predict 28-day, hospital, and 90-day mortality of sepsis with a sensitivity of 75.51%, 73.58%, and 83.33%, specificity of 78.72%, 72.09%, and 78.57%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.881, 0.830, 0.886, respectively. Thus, this research presents three multiple-biomarker-based prognostic models for 28-day, hospital, and 90-day mortality septic patients and could be used to guide sepsis treatment.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

However, detecting the progression from the stable stage to acute exacerbation mainly depends on doctors' judgment of clinical symptoms, and there is no biomarker that can be used for auxiliary clinical diagnosis. In this work, serum samples from COPD patients (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;82) and healthy subjects (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;29) were collected and analyzed. Patients with COPD were divided into stable COPD (SCOPD) and AECOPD groups, with the latter comprising subtypes 1 and 2. High-coverage lipidomics profiling of 913 lipids belonging to 19 subclasses was carried out by liquid chromatography-Q-Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry. We performed 4 cross-comparisons to characterize metabolic disturbances associated with the progression of stable COPD to AECOPD-ie, SCOPD vs healthy subjects, AECOPD vs SCOPD, AECOPD subtype 1 vs SCOPD, and AECOPD subtype 2 vs SCOPD. We tentatively identified 86 lipids with differential abundance among groups, lipids that were altered from the stable stage of disease to AECOPD included sphingolipids, ether-containing glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylglycerols, and glycerol lipids. Three panels of lipid biomarkers specific to AECOPD, AECOPD subtypes 1 and 2 vs SCOPD yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.788, 0.921 and 0.920, respectively, with sensitivity of 77.5%, 80.7% and 91.3%, respectively, and specificity of 75.8%, 97.0% and 87.9%, respectively.

No association was found between HSRs and various patient characteristics such as age, body surface area, anthracycline treatment history, IgE, and complement 3 and 4 (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of patient plasma was performed, and several metabolites showed significant association with HSRs. In particular, l-histidine (fold change = 91.5, <i>p</i> = 0.01) showed significantly higher levels in the immediate HSR group, while myristicin (fold change = 0.218, <i>p</i> = 0.003), urocanic acid (fold change = 0.193, <i>p</i> = 0.007), and d-aldose (fold change = 0.343, <i>p</i> = 0.003) showed significantly lower levels in the same group. <i>In vivo</i> experiments showed that exogenous histidine aggravated HSRs and increased IgE plasma levels in rats following the injection of PLD.

Often, multiple methods are needed to achieve sufficient lipidomic coverage to make these determinations. Multiplexed targeted assays offer a practical alternative to enable quantitative lipidomics amenable to quality control standards within a scalable platform. Herein, we developed a multiplexed normal phase liquid chromatography-hydrophilic interaction chromatography multiple reaction monitoring method that quantifies lipid molecular species across over 20 lipid classes spanning wide polarities in a single 20-min run. Analytical challenges such as in-source fragmentation, isomer separations, and concentration dynamics were addressed to ensure confidence in selectivity, quantification, and reproducibility. Utilizing multiple MS/MS product ions per lipid species not only improved the confidence of lipid identification but also enabled the determination of relative abundances of positional isomers in samples. Lipid class-based calibration curves were applied to interpolate lipid concentrations and guide sample dilution. Analytical validation was performed following FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for Industry. We report repeatable and robust quantitation of 900 lipid species measured in NIST-SRM-1950 plasma, with over 700 lipids achieving inter-assay variability below 25%. To demonstrate proof of concept for biomarker discovery, we analyzed plasma from mice treated with a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, benzoxazole 1.

Results showed that there were both common and distinct metabolome and proteome between APIS and ANPIS. APIS and ANPIS shared basic processes of AIS in inflammation and oxidative stress response.

Over the last decade, a severe threat due to Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS), caused by Xylella fastidiosa subspecies pauca, affected the Salento olive groves (Apulia, South-East Italy). Very few phyto-therapeutics, including a Zn/Cu citric acid biocomplex foliar treatment, were evaluated to mitigate this disease. However, the traditional foliar applications result in the agro-actives reaching only partially their target. Therefore the development of novel endo-therapeutic systems was suggested. Metabolite fingerprinting is a powerful method for monitoring both, disease progression and treatment effects on the plant metabolism, allowing biomarkers detection. We performed, for the first time, short-term monitoring of metabolic pathways reprogramming for infected Ogliarola salentina and Cima di Melfi olive trees after precision intravascular biocomplex delivery using a novel injection system. Upon endo therapy, we observed specific variations in the leaf content of some metabolites. In particular, the <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics approach showed, after the injection, a significant decrease of both the disease biomarker quinic acid and mannitol with simultaneous increase of polyphenols and oleuropein related compounds in the leaf's extracts.

Herein, we proposed an isotope labelled in suit derivatization-extraction integrated system for targeted analysis of all the metabolites in amine/phenol submetabolome with high efficiency and repeatability by LC-MS. The processes of in suit derivatization, alkalization and extraction were performed simultaneously in the nanopores highly dispersed between the carbon nanofibers based on the nanoconfinement effect. Isotope labelling derivatization (ILD) reagents benzoyl chloride (BzCl) and BzCl-d<sub>5</sub> were used to enhance the accuracy of identification and relative quantification.

Quantitative data reports were analyzed regarding age of onset, clinical course, and therapeutic intervention. The NMR data reveal metabolome changes consistent with a multiorgan affection in MLD patients in comparison to controls. In the MLD cohort, N-acetylaspartate (NAA) excretion in urine is elevated. Early onset MLD forms show a different metabolic profile suggesting a metabolic shift toward ketogenesis in comparison to late onset MLD and controls. In samples of juvenile MLD patients who stabilize clinically after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the macrophage activation marker neopterin is elevated. We were able to identify different metabolic patterns reflecting variable organ disturbances in MLD, including brain and energy metabolism and inflammatory processes.

However, a detailed understanding of sepsis is still limited. The present study reports the differences in the metabolic profile of serum samples of patients with sepsis compared to healthy controls using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The study also compares the NMR metabolomics on day zero of admission among sepsis survivors (those who survived till day seven) and sepsis non-survivors (those who succumbed on day zero). Furthermore, the different metabolites in serum were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis, ROC analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. Metabolites with VIP score (&gt;1&#xb7;0) were considered as potential biomarker/s to discriminate sepsis survivors from non- survivors at day zero. Data showed that phenylalanine was significantly higher in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls, whereas isoleucine, valine and histidine were significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls. Also, non-survivors had higher serum levels of creatine, phosphocreatine, choline, betaine, tyrosine, histidine and phenylalanine concentrations than survivors. These findings suggest that the metabolic alterations at day zero may predict the survival of patients with sepsis. The significant differences seen in metabolites concentration of amino acids, phospholipids and creatine may be used as early prognostic markers to discriminate non-survivors from survivors of sepsis patients at day zero. Our findings indicate that the metabolite alterations are associated with the progression of the disease.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

RIEI is a multi-factorial and multi-step process, which is regulated by a complex network of DNA, RNA, protein and metabolite. However, it is unclear which esophageal metabolites are altered by ionizing radiation and how these changes affect RIEI progression. In this work, we established a rat model of RIEI with 0-40 Gy X-ray irradiation. Esophageal irradiation using &#x2265;25 Gy induced significant changes to rats, such as body weight, food intake, water intake and esophageal structure. The metabolic changes and related pathways of rat esophageal metabolites were investigated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). One hundred eighty metabolites showed an up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner (35 Gy &#x2265; 25 Gy &gt; controls), and 199 metabolites were downregulated with increasing radiation dose (35 Gy &#x2264; 25 Gy &lt; controls). The KEGG analysis showed that ionizing radiation seriously disrupted multiple metabolic pathways, and arachidonic acid metabolism was the most significantly enriched pathway. 20 metabolites were dysregulated in arachidonic acid metabolism, including up-regulation of five prostaglandins (PGA2, PGJ2, PGD2, PGH2, and PGI2) in 25 or 35 Gy groups. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the key enzyme in catalyzing the biosynthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, was highly expressed in the esophagus of irradiated rats. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that PGJ2 may serve as a promising tissue biomarker for RIEI diagnosis.

Here, we performed untargeted lipidomics analysis of synovial fluid and serum from RA patients at different disease activities and clinical phases (preclinical phase to active phase to sustained remission). We found that the lipidome profile in RA joint fluid was severely perturbed and that this correlated with the extent of inflammation and severity of synovitis on ultrasonography. The serum lipidome profile of active RA, albeit less prominent than the synovial lipidome, was also distinguishable from that of RA in the sustained remission phase and from that of noninflammatory osteoarthritis. Of note, the serum lipidome profile at the preclinical phase of RA closely mimicked that of active RA. Specifically, alterations in a set of lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin subclasses correlated with RA activity, reflecting treatment responses to anti-rheumatic drugs when monitored serially.

Current diagnosis techniques are either highly invasive or lack sufficient sensitivity. Thus, identifying diagnostic biomarkers of CRC with high sensitivity and specificity is desirable. Metabolomics represents an analytical profiling technique with great promise in identifying such biomarkers and typically represents a close tie with the phenotype of a specific disease. We thus conducted a systematic review of studies reported from January 2012 to July 2021 relating to the detection of CRC biomarkers through metabolomics to provide a collection of knowledge for future diagnostic development. We identified thirty-seven metabolomics studies characterizing CRC, many of which provided metabolites/metabolic profile-based diagnostic models with high sensitivity and specificity. These studies demonstrated that a great number of metabolites can be differentially regulated in CRC patients compared to healthy controls, adenomatous polyps, or across stages of CRC. Among these metabolite biomarkers, especially dysregulated were certain amino acids, fatty acids, and lysophosphatidylcholines. Additionally, we discussed the contribution of the gut bacterial population to pathogenesis of CRC through their modulation to fecal metabolite pools and summarized the established links in the literature between certain microbial genera and altered metabolite levels in CRC patients.

Whereas targeted approaches only provide information for the selected markers, thus hampering the determination of out-of-the-box markers, the common bottleneck of untargeted metabolomics is the identification of detected biomarkers. In this study, we developed a strategy based on derivatization and LC-MS/MS detection in a precursor ion scan for the untargeted determination of a specific part of the metabolome (carbonyl-containing metabolites). The usefulness of this guided metabolomics approach has been demonstrated by elucidating carbonyl-containing biomarkers of COVID-19 severity. First, the LC-MS/MS behavior of 63 model compounds after O-benzylhydroxylamine derivatization was studied. A precursor ion scan of m/z 91 was selected as a suitable approach for the untargeted detection of carbonyl-containing metabolites. The method was able to detect &#x2248;300 potential carbonyl-containing molecules in plasma, including mono-/di-/tricarbonylic compounds with satisfactory intra-day and inter-day repeatability and RSDs commonly &lt;15%. Additionally, the semiquantitative nature of the precursor ion scan method was confirmed by comparison with a fully validated targeted method. The application of the guided metabolomics method to COVID-19 plasma samples revealed the presence of four potential COVID-19 severity biomarkers. Based on their LC-MS/MS behavior, these biomarkers were elucidated as 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2,3-dihydroxybutyrate, 2-oxobutyrate and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate. Their structures were confirmed by comparison with reference materials. The alterations of these biomarkers with COVID-19 severity were confirmed by a target analysis of a larger set of samples.

To define the metabolic impact of M. tuberculosis infection, we performed global metabolic profiling of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages. M. tuberculosis induced metabolic hallmarks of inflammatory macrophages and a prominent signature of cholesterol metabolism. We found that infected macrophages accumulate cholestenone, a mycobacterial-derived, oxidized derivative of cholesterol. We demonstrated that the accumulation of cholestenone in infected macrophages depended on the M. tuberculosis enzyme 3&#x3b2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3&#x3b2;-Hsd) and correlated with pathogen burden. Because cholestenone is not a substantial human metabolite, we hypothesized it might be diagnostic of M. tuberculosis infection in clinical samples. Indeed, in 2 geographically distinct cohorts, sputum cholestenone levels distinguished subjects with tuberculosis (TB) from TB-negative controls who presented with TB-like symptoms. We also found country-specific detection of cholestenone in plasma samples from M. tuberculosis-infected subjects. While cholestenone was previously thought to be an intermediate required for cholesterol degradation by M. tuberculosis, we found that M. tuberculosis can utilize cholesterol for growth without making cholestenone.

Investigating the tear metabo-lipidome could improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of both ocular and systemic diseases, but also provide diagnostic as well as prognostic biomarkers.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

Pre-treatment with N-Asta or S-Asta for 14 days restored the cellular morphology of the intestine and increased glutathione (GSH) levels under PCM overdose in rats. However, S-Asta displayed higher adsorption than that of N-Asta. PCM overdose reduced the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota in the model group. Comparably, N-Asta or S-Asta pre-treatment increased the Actinobacteria abundance. Increased phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were only found in the S-Asta-pre-treated group. At the genus level, N-Asta pre-treatment increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> abundance, whereas S-Asta pre-treatment elevated <i>Bacteroidales_S24-7_group_norank</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae_uncultured</i>. Compared to the control and model groups, remarkable increases of fecal short-chain fatty acids were detected in both N-Asta and S-Asta pre-treatment groups, suggesting the contribution of N-Asta and S-Asta adsorption to SCFA-producing bacteria enrichment. Furthermore, the genera of <i>Ruminococcaceae_uncultured, Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_unclassified</i> and <i>Ruminococcus_1</i> showed high correlations with propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid and valeric acid increases in the S-Asta pre-treated group. Seventeen plasma biomarker metabolites in more than 10 metabolic pathways were responsible for the difference between the N-Asta and S-Asta pre-treated groups. Metabolites GSH, retinol, all-<i>trans</i>-Retinoic acid and taurine related to antioxidant activities were significantly accumulated in the S-Asta pre-treated group, while increasing taurocholic acid levels associated with the anti-inflammatory activity was found in the N-Asta-pre-treated group.

To further validate our results in a large real-world patient cohort, we designed a multicentric observational prospective study (PARASOL) including six independent European transplant centers. This article describes the study protocol and characteristics of recruited better patients as subjects. <b>Methods:</b> Within the PARASOL study, urine samples were taken from renal transplant recipients when kidney biopsies were performed. According to the Banff classification, urine samples were assigned to a case group (renal allograft rejection), a control group (normal renal histology), or an additional group (kidney damage other than rejection). <b>Results:</b> Between June 2017 and March 2020, 972 transplant recipients were included in the trial (1,230 urine samples and matched biopsies, respectively). Overall, 237 samples (19.3%) were assigned to the case group, 541 (44.0%) to the control group, and 452 (36.7%) samples to the additional group. About 65.9% were obtained from male patients, the mean age of transplant recipients participating in the study was 53.7 &#xb1; 13.8 years. The most frequently used immunosuppressive drugs were tacrolimus (92.8%), mycophenolate mofetil (88.0%), and steroids (79.3%). Antihypertensives and antidiabetics were used in 88.0 and 27.4% of the patients, respectively. Approximately 20.9% of patients showed the presence of circulating donor-specific anti-HLA IgG antibodies at time of biopsy. Most of the samples (51.1%) were collected within the first 6 months after transplantation, 48.0% were protocol biopsies, followed by event-driven (43.6%), and follow-up biopsies (8.5%). Over time the proportion of biopsies classified into the categories Banff 4 (T-cell-mediated rejection [TCMR]) and Banff 1 (normal tissue) decreased whereas Banff 2 (antibody-mediated rejection [ABMR]) and Banff 5I (mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) increased to 84.2 and 74.5%, respectively, after 4 years post transplantation. Patients with rejection showed worse kidney function than patients without rejection. <b>Conclusion:</b> The clinical characteristics of subjects recruited indicate a patient cohort typical for routine renal transplantation all over Europe. A typical shift from T-cellular early rejections episodes to later antibody mediated allograft damage over time after renal transplantation further strengthens the usefulness of our cohort for the evaluation of novel biomarkers for allograft damage.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for metabolomic studies of PWE and epileptic models published before December 2020. The study objectives, types of models and reported differentially altered metabolites were examined and compared. Pathway analyses were performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 online software. Thirty-five studies were included in this review. Metabolites such as glutamate, lactate and citrate were disturbed in both PWE and epileptic models, which might be potential biomarkers of epilepsy. Metabolic pathways including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; glycerophospholipid metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; and arginine and proline metabolism were involved in epilepsy. These pathways might play important roles in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Although various biochemical tests, including ketone bodies and hemoglobin A1c, have been used to diagnose diabetes in the postmortem setting, each marker has some limitations. Consequently, it would be helpful in forensic practice to find new biomarkers reflecting the decedent's history of DM irrespective of whether the DM was being treated. Metabolomics enables the non-targeting analysis of biomarkers, and metabolomics was performed on postmortem blood from decedents with and without a DM history to determine whether a marker reflecting DM could be identified. The statistical analysis, including primary component analysis, presented a potent set of metabolites that could be used for the forensic diagnosis of DM. Qualitative analysis revealed significantly lower sphingomyelin and plasmalogen lipid levels and higher lysophospholipid levels in the DM group. Meanwhile, some discrepancies in the levels of some classes of phospholipids were noted between samples from living and deceased persons.

We first used a case-control design (75 idiopathic cases and 29 controls, enrolled at Boston Children's Hospital from 2007-2012) to identify plasma biomarkers of ASD through a metabolome-wide association study approach. Then we leveraged a family-based design (31 families) to investigate the influence of shared genetic and environmental components on the autism-associated features. Using untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry metabolomics platforms, we detected 19 184 features. Of these, 191 were associated with ASD (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05).

This study recruited 577 participants, including healthy controls (HCs), type-2 DM (2-DM) patients, and DN patients, from the clinic. Serum samples were collected under fasting conditions. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based lipidomics methods were used to explore the lipid changes in the serum and identify potential lipid biomarkers for the diagnosis of DN. Lipidomics revealed that the combination of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) (16:0) and triacylglycerol (TAG) 54:2-FA18:1 was a biomarker panel for predicting DN. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the panel had a sensitivity of 89.1% and 73.4% with a specificity of 88.1% and 76.7% for discriminating patients with DN from HCs and 2-DM patients. Then, we divided the DN patients in the validation cohort into microalbuminuria (diabetic nephropathy at an early stage, DNE) and macroalbuminuria (diabetic nephropathy at an advanced stage, DNA) groups and found that LPE(16:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (16:0/20:2), and TAG54:2-FA18:1 were tightly associated with the stages of DN.

Here, they are present together with MV from the various blood and endothelial cells. Harvesting MV from 78 breast cancer patients (BC) and 30 controls, we characterized the whole blood MV metabolome using targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry. Especially (lyso)-phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins were detected in a relevant abundance. Eight metabolites showed a significant discriminatory power between BC and controls. High concentrations of lysoPCaC26:0 and PCaaC38:5 were associated with shorter overall survival. Comparing BC subtype-specific metabolome profiles, 24 metabolites were differentially expressed between luminal A and luminal B. Pathway analysis revealed alterations in the glycerophospholipid metabolism for the whole cancer cohort and in the ether lipid metabolism for the molecular subtype luminal B. Although this mixture of blood-derived MV contains only a minor number of tumor MV, a combination of metabolites was identified that distinguished between BC and controls as well as between molecular subtypes, and was predictive for overall survival.

Our aim is to evaluate angiogenic/vasculogenic/inflammatory proteins and lipid profile in plasma of MA patients and control subjects (healthy donors HD or subjects with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease ACVD). Angiogenic and inflammatory protein levels were measured by ELISA and a complete lipidomic analysis was performed on plasma by mass spectrometry. ELISA showed a significant decrease for MMP-9 released in plasma of MA. The untargeted lipidomic analysis showed a cumulative depletion of lipid asset in plasma of MA as compared to HD. Specifically, a decrease in membrane complex glycosphingolipids peripherally circulating in MA plasma with respect to HD was observed, likely suggestive of cerebral cellular recruitment. The quantitative targeted approach demonstrated an increase in free sphingoid bases, likely associated with a deregulated angiogenesis.

Furthermore, this new approach has enabled nutrition research to identify dietary biomarkers and to deepen the understanding of metabolic dynamics and the impacts on health risks. However, so far, candidate markers identified by metabolomics have not been clinically applied and more efforts should be made to validate those. To help nutrition researchers better understand the potential of its application, this scoping review outlined the historical transition, recent focuses, and future prospects of the new realm, based on trends in the number of human research articles from the early stage of 2000 to the present of 2019 by searching the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE). Among them, objective dietary assessment, metabolic profiling, and health risk prediction were positioned as three of the principal applications. The continued growth will enable nutrimetabolomics research to contribute to personalized nutrition in the future.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

Advanced imaging techniques have shown altered myocardial energetics already in preclinical gene variant carriers. To determine whether disturbed myocardial energetics with the potential to serve as biomarkers are also reflected in the serum metabolome, we analyzed the serum metabolome of asymptomatic carriers in comparison to healthy controls and obstructive HCM patients (HOCM). We performed non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics on serum from fasted asymptomatic gene variant carriers, symptomatic HOCM patients and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 31, 14 and 9, respectively). Biomarker panels that discriminated the groups were identified by performing multivariate modeling with gradient-boosting classifiers. For all three group-wise comparisons we identified a panel of 30 serum metabolites that best discriminated the groups. These metabolite panels performed equally well as advanced cardiac imaging modalities in distinguishing the groups. Seven metabolites were found to be predictive in two different comparisons and may play an important role in defining the disease stage. This study reveals unique metabolic signatures in serum of preclinical carriers and HOCM patients that may potentially be used for HCM risk stratification and precision therapeutics.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

Residues of ALT and its metabolites may reach the aquatic environment via the spread of liquid manure and may present a risk for fish and other higher aquatic organisms due to its endocrine disrupting potential. A pilot study was conducted in which spot urine samples from ALT-treated and non-medicated gilts were collected. We applied LC-HRMS analysis to perform targeted analysis of ALT and known metabolites as well as non-targeted metabolomics analyses to find previously unknown metabolites. The targeted investigation showed that glucuronide conjugates of ALT and its photo-isomerization product are main urinary metabolites of ALT in gilts. Furthermore, an unknown isomerization product of ALT was observed at trace level, whereas ALT and ALT sulfate were not found. The chemometric analysis of non-targeted data revealed a clear difference between ALT-treated gilts and control animals. Furthermore, a hydroxylated ALT glucuronide was identified as highly significant in the ALT-treated group. Additional biomarker annotation and pathway mapping revealed changes in the metabolism of ALT-treated animals which can be explained by ALT's hormonal action. This study illustrates the exceptional potential of LC-HRMS and metabolomics for the detection of potentially new environmental contaminants with high biological activity. Further advantages of the method described are the sampling during routine breeding conditions, a relatively small number of animals required and no particular stress for the animals.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

However, there is still a lack of efficient medical methods to diagnosis PD before apparent symptoms occur. In recent years, clinical biomarkers including genetic, imaging, and tissue markers have exhibited remarkable benefits in assisting PD diagnoses. Due to the advantages of high-throughput detection of metabolites and almost non-invasive sample collection, metabolomics research of PD is widely used for diagnostic biomarker discovery. However, there are also a few shortages for those identified biomarkers, such as the scarcity of verifications regarding the sensitivity and specificity. Thus, reviewing the research progress of PD biomarkers based on metabolomics techniques is of great significance for developing PD diagnosis. To comprehensively clarify the progress of current metabolic biomarker studies in PD, we reviewed 20 research articles regarding the discovery and validation of biomarkers for PD diagnosis from three mainstream academic databases (NIH PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Elsevier ScienceDirect). By analyzing those materials, we summarized the metabolic biomarkers identified by those metabolomics studies and discussed the potential approaches used for biomarker verifications. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive and updated overview of PD metabolomics research in the past two decades and particularly discusses the validation of disease biomarkers. We hope those discussions might provide inspiration for PD biomarker discovery and verification in the future.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

Although the effects of FB on sphinganine (Sa) and sphingosine (So) are well documented in poultry, little information is available on their other effects on sphingolipids. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of FB on the hepatic and plasma sphingolipidome in chickens. The first concern of this analysis was to clarify the effects of FB on hepatic sphingolipid levels, whose variations can lead to numerous toxic manifestations. The second was to specify the possible use of an alteration of the sphingolipidome as a biomarker of exposure to FB, in addition to the measurement of the Sa:So ratio already widely used. For this purpose, we developed an UHPLC MS/MS method that enabled the determination of 82 SL, including 10 internal standards, in chicken liver and plasma. The validated method was used to measure the effects of FB administered to chickens at a dose close to 20 mg FB1 + FB2/kg feed for 9 days. Significant alterations of sphingoid bases, ceramides, dihydroceramides, glycosylceramides, sphingomyelins and dihydrosphingomyelins were observed in the liver. In addition, significant increases in plasma sphinganine 1-phosphate, sphingosine 1-phosphate and sphingomyelins were observed in plasma. Interestingly, partial least-squares discriminant analysis of 11 SL in plasma made it possible to discriminate exposed chickens from control chickens, whereas analysis of Sa and So alone revealed no difference. In conclusion, our results show that the effects of FB in chickens are complex, and that SL profiling enables the detection of exposure to FB when Sa and So fail.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

At the early stage of RRT, serum metabolic biomarkers might differntiate patients with a high risk of mortality or permanent kidney injury from those who can recover. Serum samples from participants enrolled in the Veteran's Affairs/National Institutes of Health Acute Renal Failure Trial Network study were collected on day 1 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;97) and day 8 (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;105) of randomized RRT. The samples were further evaluated using LC/MS-based metabolic profiling. A model predicting mortality by day 8 was built from samples collected on day 1 and based on four metabolites with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.641. A model most predictive of mortality by day 28 was built from the levels of 11 serum metabolites from day 8 with an AUC of 0.789. Both day 1 and day 8 samples had lower serum levels of 1-arachidonoyl-lysoPC and 1-eicosatetraenoyl-lysoPC (involved in anti-inflammatory processes) in the critically ill patients who died by day 8 or day 28.

In this study, the aim was to reduce the production costs for an innovative type of microbial biosurfactant: bolaform sophorolipids, produced by the yeast Starmerella bombicola &#x394;sble&#x394;at. A novel continuous retentostat set-up was performed whereby continuous broth microfiltration retained the biomass in the bioreactor while performing an in situ product separation of bolaform sophorolipids. Although a mean volumetric productivity of 0.56 g L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> was achieved, it was not possible to maintain this productivity, which collapsed to almost 0 g L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Therefore, two process adaptations were evaluated, a sequential batch strategy and a phosphate limitation alleviation strategy. The sequential batch set-up restored the mean volumetric productivity to 0.66 g L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for an additional 132 h but was again followed by a productivity decline. A similar result was obtained with the phosphate limitation alleviation strategy where a mean volumetric productivity of 0.54 g L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> was reached, but a productivity decline was also observed. Whole genome variant analysis uncovered no evidence for genomic variations for up to 1306 h of retentostat cultivation. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified 8-hydroxyguanosine, a biomarker for oxidative RNA damage, as a key metabolite correlating with high bolaform sophorolipid productivity.

High-resolution global and targeted <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics as well as neurofilament-light chain measurements were performed on the serum in four groups of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients, stratified by time since relapse onset: (i) in relapse (R); (ii) last relapse (LR) &#x2265; 1 month (M) to &lt; 6 M ago; (iii) LR &#x2265; 6 M to &lt; 24 M ago; and (iv) LR &#x2265; 24 M ago.

When comparing 27 patients with T1a RCC and 10 with benign tumor, a significant difference was observed between pre- and postoperative concentrations among 10 urinary metabolites. In these 10 metabolites, multiple logistic regression analysis identified five metabolites (lactic acid, glycine, 2-hydroxyglutarate, succinic acid, and kynurenic acid) as factors to build our recurrence prediction model. The values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity in this predictive model were 0.894%, 88.9%, and 88.0%, respectively. When stratified into low and high risk groups of recurrence based on this model, we found a significant drop of recurrence-free survival rates among the high risk group. In in vitro studies, intracellular metabolite concentrations of metastatic tumor cell lines were much higher than those of primary tumor cell lines. By using our quantitative evaluation of urinary metabolites, we could predict postoperative recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity. Urinary metabolites could be noninvasive biomarkers to improve patient outcome.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

We integrated data on the gut microbiota, blood parameters and urine metabolites of treatment-naive individuals presenting a wide range of metabolic disease phenotypes to delineate clinically meaningful associations. Trans-omics correlation networks revealed that candidate gut microbial biomarkers and urine metabolite feature were covaried with distinct clinical phenotypes. Integration of the gut microbiome, the urine metabolome and the phenome revealed that variations in one of these three systems correlated with changes in the other two. In a specific note about clinical parameters of liver function, we identified Eubacteriumeligens, Faecalibacteriumprausnitzii and Ruminococcuslactaris to be associated with a healthy liver function, whereas Clostridium bolteae, Tyzzerellanexills, Ruminococcusgnavus, Blautiahansenii, and Atopobiumparvulum were associated with blood biomarkers for liver diseases. Variations in these microbiota features paralleled changes in specific urine metabolites. Network modeling yielded two core clusters including one large gut microbe-urine metabolite close-knit cluster and one triangular cluster composed of a gut microbe-blood-urine network, demonstrating close inter-system crosstalk especially between the gut microbiome and the urine metabolome. Distinct clinical phenotypes are manifested in both the gut microbiome and the urine metabolome, and inter-domain connectivity takes the form of high-dimensional networks. Such networks may further our understanding of complex biological systems, and may provide a basis for identifying biomarkers for diseases. Deciphering the complexity of human physiology and disease requires a holistic and trans-omics approach integrating multi-layer data sets, including the gut microbiome and profiles of biological fluids. By studying the gut microbiome on carotid atherosclerosis, we identified microbial features associated with clinical parameters, and we observed that groups of urine metabolites correlated with groups of clinical parameters. Combining the three data sets, we revealed correlations of entities across the three systems, suggesting that physiological changes are reflected in each of the omics.

These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

We collected early and late pregnancy urine samples for cotinine measurement and serum samples for high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) profiling from 105 pregnant women from the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child cohort (2014-2016). Maternal metabolome perturbations mediating prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and adverse birth outcomes were assessed by an untargeted HRM workflow using generalized linear models, followed by pathway enrichment analysis and chemical annotation, with a meet-in-the-middle approach. The median maternal urinary cotinine concentrations were 5.93&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/g creatinine and 3.69&#xa0;&#x3bc;g/g creatinine in early and late pregnancy, respectively.

Its success highly depends on the way the characterization of the disease and its evolution, the patient's classification, its follow-up and the treatment could be optimized. Thus, personalized medicine must combine innovative tools to measure, integrate and model data. Towards this goal, clinical metabolomics appears as ideally suited to obtain relevant information. Indeed, the metabolomics signature brings crucial insight to stratify patients according to their responses to a pathology and/or a treatment, to provide prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, and to improve therapeutic outcomes. However, the translation of metabolomics from laboratory studies to clinical practice remains a subsequent challenge.

SESI-MS is the most recently developed analytical platform displaying particular adequate characteristics for breath analysis, such as the low detection limits, and the detection of low volatility species, which tend to present a higher biological significance. Here, we review the SESI technology development, the different SESI configurations developed, and the standardization procedures described to translate SESI into the clinical environment. Finally, SESI main applications described in the literature with prompt translation into the clinical environment, namely, biomarker discovery or pharmacokinetics and drug monitoring are revised.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2023}

Systems biological methods have been used to comprehensively characterize the impact of toxicants on the biochemical pathways. However, the majority of the current studies are only based on single-dose, and limited information can be extrapolated to other doses from these experiments, regardless of the sensitivity of each endpoint. This study aims to understand the dose-response metabolite dysregulation pattern and metabolite sensitivity at the system-biological level. Here, we applied bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), as the model chemical. We first employed the global metabolomics method to characterize the metabolome of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) upon exposure to different doses (0, 20, 50, and 100&#xa0;&#xb5;M) of BPA. The dysregulated features with a clear dose-response relationship were also effectively picked up with an R-package named TOXcms. Overall, most metabolites were dysregulated by showing a significant dose-dependent behaviour. The results suggested that BPA exposure greatly perturbed purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism. Interestingly, most metabolites within the purine metabolism were described as a biphasic dose-response relationship. With the established dose-response relationship, we were able to fully map the metabolite cartography of BPA exposure within a wide range of concentrations and observe some unique patterns. Furthermore, an effective concentration of certain fold changes (e.g., EC<sub>+10</sub> means the dose at which metabolite is 10% upregulated) and metabolite sensitivity were defined and introduced to this dose-response omics information. The result showed that the purine metabolism pathway is the most venerable target of BPA, which can be a potential endogenous biomarker for its exposure. Overall, this study applied the dose-response metabolomics method to fully understand the biochemical pathway disruption of BPA treatment at different doses. Both dose-response omics strategy and metabolite sensitivity analysis can be further considered and emphasized in future chemical risk assessments.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

Using an untargeted metabolomics approach together with appropriate chemometrics tools, the differential metabolite profiles of leaf and root extracts from five cultivars of barley ('Erica', 'Elim', 'Hessekwa', 'S16' and 'Agulhas') were explored and potential signatory biomarkers were revealed. The study was conducted on seedlings grown for 21 days under identical controlled conditions. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) was employed to analyse hydromethanolic leaf and root extracts of barley cultivars. Furthermore, unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms were applied to mine the generated data and to pinpoint cultivar-specific metabolites. Among all the classes of metabolites annotated, phenolic acids and derivatives formed the largest group and also represented the most discriminatory metabolites. In roots, saponarin, an important allelochemical differentially distributed across cultivars, was the only flavonoid annotated.

Specific metabolites in blood and urine can be used as biomarkers and become an important diagnostic indicator for DON poisoning monitoring. This study aimed to reveal the differences in DON-induced metabolites in the serum and urine of weaned rabbits. Thirty-two weaned rabbits were divided into two groups: control group and DON group. Both groups of rabbits were fed a basic diet. Rabbits in the DON group were administered 1.5&#xa0;mg/kg b.w. DON by intraperitoneal injection on an empty stomach in the morning every two days. Rabbits in the control group were injected with the same amount of saline every two days in the same way. After the 25-day trial, serum and urine samples from different experimental periods were collected. The results based on the LC-MS/MS method showed that DON can be metabolized rapidly in blood, and urine is the main metabolic pathway for DON. Data based on metabolomics illustrated that underlying biomarkers in serum were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and pentose and glucuronate interconversions, while those in urine samples were involved in caffeine metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Correlation analysis suggested that DON can induce changes in certain disease-related metabolites in serum and urine. In conclusion, the pathogenic mechanism of DON includes multiple levels, indicating that DON poisoning is caused by multiple factors acting on multiple links.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

The objective of this study was to determine whether urinary metabolites are significantly altered post-SRC compared to pre-injury. <b>Setting:</b> Outpatient sports medicine clinic. <b>Participants:</b> Twenty-six male youth sport participants. <b>Methods:</b> Urine was analyzed pre-injury and after SRC by <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistics, pairwise <i>t</i>-test, and metabolic pathway analysis. Variable importance analysis based on random variable combination (VIAVC) was applied to the entire data set and resulted in a panel of 18 features. Partial least square discriminant analysis was performed exploring the separation between pre-injury and post-SRC groups. Pathway topography analysis was completed to identify biological pathway involvement. Spearman correlations provide support for the relationships between symptom burden and length of return to play and quantifiable metabolic changes in the human urinary metabolome. <b>Results:</b> Phenylalanine and 3-indoxysulfate were upregulated, while citrate, propylene glycol, 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine, anserine, and carnosine were downregulated following SRC. A receiver operator curve (ROC) tool constructed using the 18-feature classifier had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.887. A pairwise <i>t</i>-test found an additional 19 altered features, 7 of which overlapped with the VIAVC analysis. Pathway topology analysis indicated that aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and beta-alanine metabolism were the two pathways most significantly changed. There was a significant positive correlation between post-SRC 2-hydroxybutyrate and the length of return to play (&#x3c1; = 0.482, <i>p</i> = 0.02) as well as the number of symptoms and post-SRC lactose (&#x3c1; = 0.422, <i>p</i> = 0.036). <b>Conclusion:</b> We found that <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolomic urinary analysis can identify a set of metabolites that can correctly classify SRC with an accuracy of 81.6%, suggesting potential for a more objective method of characterizing SRC.

Although metabolomics, alone or combined with other omics data, has already demonstrated its relevance for patient stratification in the frame of research projects and clinical studies, much remains to be done to move this approach to the clinical practice. This is especially true in the perspective of being applied to personalized/precision medicine, which aims at stratifying patients according to their risk of developing diseases, and tailoring medical treatments of patients according to individual characteristics in order to improve their efficacy and limit their toxicity. In this review article, we discuss the main challenges linked to analytical chemistry that need to be addressed to foster the implementation of metabolomics in the clinics and the use of the data produced by this approach in personalized medicine. First of all, there are already well-known issues related to untargeted metabolomics workflows at the levels of data production (lack of standardization), metabolite identification (small proportion of annotated features and identified metabolites), and data processing (from automatic detection of features to multi-omic data integration) that hamper the inter-operability and reusability of metabolomics data. Furthermore, the outputs of metabolomics workflows are complex molecular signatures of few tens of metabolites, often with small abundance variations, and obtained with expensive laboratory equipment. It is thus necessary to simplify these molecular signatures so that they can be produced and used in the field. This last point, which is still poorly addressed by the metabolomics community, may be crucial in a near future with the increased availability of molecular signatures of medical relevance and the increased societal demand for participatory medicine.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

Advanced analytical tools, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), and non-destructive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, have facilitated metabolite profiling of complex biological matrices. Metabolomics, along with transcriptomics, has an influential role in discovering connections between genetic regulation, metabolite phenotyping and biomarkers identification. Comprehensive metabolite profiling allows integration of the summarized data towards manipulation of biosynthetic pathways, determination of nutritional quality markers, improvement in crop yield, selection of desired metabolites/genes, and their heritability in modern breeding. Along with that, metabolomics is invaluable in predicting the biological activity of medicinal plants, assisting the bioactivity-guided fractionation process and bioactive leads discovery, as well as serving as a tool for quality control and authentication of commercial plant-derived natural products. Metabolomic analysis of human biofluids is implemented in clinical practice to discriminate between physiological and pathological state in humans, to aid early disease biomarker discovery and predict individual response to drug therapy.

Results also illustrated several metabolites with different pattern of modulations in control, infected and treated samples as well as in different tissues/biofluids; for e.g. glutamic acid identified in the serum samples of infected mice.

Multiple extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) from SWATH data of diagnostic ions on MS1 and MS2 level from both positive and negative ion mode allowed to distinguish between poorly resolved isomeric lipids based on their distinct fragment ions, which were used for relative quantification at a molecular lipid species level. It supports assay specificity for relative lipid quantitation via multiple quantifiably ions unlike to data-dependent acquisition methods which rely on precursor ions only. This approach was used to analyze human platelet samples. 457 lipids were annotated. Concentrations of lipids were estimated by stable isotope-labelled lipid class-specific internal standards as surrogate calibrants. Heatmaps of lipid concentrations in dependence on carbon and double bond numbers for the distinct lipid classes revealed a snapshot of the platelet lipidome in the resting state with lipid species distributions within classes supporting some functional interpretations. As expected, activation of the platelets by thrombin has led to significant alterations in the platelet lipidome as proven by univariate (volcano plot) and multivariate (PLS-DA) statistics. Several lipids were significantly up-regulated (lysophosphatidylinositols, oxylipins such as thromboxane B2 (TXB2), hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), sphingoid-bases, (very) long chain saturated fatty acids) or down-regulated (lysophosphatidylethanolamines, polyunsaturated fatty acids, phosphatidylinositols). Several of them are well known as biomarkers of platelet activation while others may provide some further insights into pathways of platelet activation and platelet metabolism.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

Currently, there is a lack of valid diagnostic biomarkers and few therapeutic strategies are available for CRC treatment, especially for advanced CRC whose underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the serum samples from 20 patients with stage III or IV advanced CRC using data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based proteomics and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS/MS) metabolomics techniques. Overall, 551 proteins and 719 metabolites were identified. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the serum proteomes of advanced CRC are more diversified than the metabolomes. Ten biochemical pathways associated with cancer cell metabolism were enriched in the detected proteins and metabolites, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis of amino acids, glutathione metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism, etc. A protein-protein interaction network in advanced CRC serum was constructed with 80 proteins and 21 related metabolites. Correlation analysis revealed conserved roles of lipids and lipid-like molecules in a regulatory network of advanced CRC. Three metabolites (hydroquinone, leucenol and sphingomyelin) and two proteins (coagulation factor XIII A chain and plasma kallikrein) were selected to be potential biomarkers for advanced CRC, which are positively and significantly correlated with CEA and/or CA 19-9. Altogether, the results expanded our understanding of the physiopathology of advanced CRC and discovered novel potential biomarkers for further validation and application to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of advanced CRC.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

This study aimed to screen the metabolites to predict patients' sensitivity to propofol and to identify metabolic pathways to explore possible mechanisms associated with propofol resistance. Sera from 40 female patients undergoing elective hysteroscopic surgery in a prospective cohort propofol study were obtained before the administration of propofol. The patients' responsiveness to propofol was differentiated based on propofol effect-site concentration. Serum samples from two sets, a discovery set (<i>n</i> = 24) and an independent validation set (<i>n</i> = 16), were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics. In the discovery set, 494 differential metabolites were screened out, and then 391 potential candidate biomarkers with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve &gt;0.80 were selected. Pathway analysis showed that the pathway of glycerophospholipid metabolism was the most influential pathway. In the independent validation set, six potential biomarkers enabled the discrimination of poor responders from good and intermediate responders, which might be applied to predict propofol sensitivity.

Recent studies have shown that, in regression models using \"-omic\" platforms to predict chronological age, residual variation in predicted age is correlated with health outcomes, and suggest that these \"omic clocks\" provide measures of biological age. This paper presents predictive models for age using metabolomic profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from healthy human subjects and finds that metabolite and lipid data are generally able to predict chronological age within 10 years. We use these models to predict the age of a cohort of subjects with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and find an increase in prediction error, potentially indicating that the relationship between the metabolome and chronological age differs with these diseases. However, evidence is not found to support the hypothesis that our models will consistently overpredict the age of these subjects. In our analysis of control subjects, we find the carnitine shuttle, sucrose, biopterin, vitamin E metabolism, tryptophan, and tyrosine to be the most associated with age. We showcase the potential usefulness of age prediction models in a small data set (n = 85) and discuss techniques for drift correction, missing data imputation, and regularized regression, which can be used to help mitigate the statistical challenges that commonly arise in this setting. To our knowledge, this work presents the first multivariate predictive metabolomic and lipidomic models for age using mass spectrometry analysis of CSF.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2022}

To date, most LC patients are diagnosed at the advanced stage owing to the lack of obvious symptoms in the early stage and the limitations of current clinical diagnostic techniques. Therefore, developing a high throughput technique for early screening is of great importance. In this work, we established an effective and rapid salivary metabolic analysis platform for early LC diagnosis and combined metabolomics and transcriptomics to reveal the metabolic fluctuations correlated to LC. Saliva samples were collected from a total of 150 volunteers including 89 patients with early LC, 11 patients with advanced LC, and 50 healthy controls. The metabolic profiling of noninvasive samples was investigated on an ultralow noise TELDI-MS platform. In addition, data normalization methods were screened and assessed to overcome the MS signal variation caused by individual difference for biomarker mining. For untargeted metabolic profiling of saliva samples, around 264 peaks could be reliably detected in each sample. After multivariate analysis, 23 metabolites were sorted out and verified to be related to the dysfunction of the amino acid and nucleotide metabolism in early LC. Notably, transcriptomic data from online TCGA repository were utilized to support findings from the salivary metabolomics experiment, including the disorder of amino acid biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism. Based on the verified differential metabolites, early LC patients could be clearly distinguished from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 97.2% and a specificity of 92%. The ultralow noise TELDI-MS platform displayed satisfactory ability to explore salivary metabolite information and discover potential biomarkers that may help develop a noninvasive screening tool for early LC.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}

One class of such compounds are carbonyl-containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi-quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics-driven biomarker discovery.

Naringin, deacetylnomilin, citric acid, limonin, and nomilin were the characteristic components of <i>Citrus wilsonii</i> Tanaka. Although the fruit of <i>Citrus wilsonii</i> Tanaka possessed many applications, there was a lack of research on the growth period and drying process. In this study, plant metabolomics was used to analyze the biomarkers of the growth period, and appearance indicators and metabolites abundance were combined for the analysis of change regularities of the growth period. The representative differential metabolites of naringin, citric acid, and limonin were screened out, and the abundance of these components was relatively highest in the middle of the growth period. Therefore, the fruit of <i>Citrus wilsonii</i> Tanaka should be harvested before it turned yellow completely, which could effectively ensure the content of potential active ingredients. In the comparison of different drying methods, citric acid and naringin were considered to be representative differential components, but limonoids were relatively stable and not easily affected by drying methods. Naringin was an index component that could not only be reflected the maturity but also related to different drying methods. Considering its physical and chemical properties and its position, naringin had the potential to be a biomarker of <i>Citrus wilsonii</i> Tanaka.","full_text":null,"metabo_id":null,"traditional_citations":0,"year":2021}
